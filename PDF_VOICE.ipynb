He sits in the topmost tiers ofpolymer, glass, and steel, dangling his pulsing legs, surveying at a distancethewrithinglifeoftheplanet. Inthisscenario,Man comes on as a stupendous lethal force, and the earth is pictured as something delicate, like rising bubbles at the surface of a country pond, or flights of fragile birds. But it is illusion to think that there is anything fragile about the life ofthe earth; surely this is the toughest mem- brane imaginable in the universe, opaque to probability, impermeable to death. We are the delicate part, transient and vulnerable as cilia. Nor is it a new thing for man to invent an existence that he imagines to be above the rest of life; this has been his most consistent intellectual exertion down the millennia. As illusion, it has never worked out to his satisfaction in thepast, any more than itdoes today. Man is embedded in nature. The biologic scienceofrecentyears has been making this a more urgent fact of life. The new, hard problem will be to cope with the dawning, intensifying realization of just how interlocked we are. The old, clung-to notions most of us have held about our special lordship are being deeply undermined. Item. A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed,4 The Lives ofa Cell of successively enriched packets ofour own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior ofour cells, driv- ing them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mito- chondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors ofour eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much symbionts as the rhizobial bacteria in the rootsofbeans. Withoutthem, wewould notmoveamuscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own specialgenome, are asforeign,and asessential, asaphids inanthills. Mycellsare no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex thanJamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. I am consoled, somewhat, by the thought that the green plants are in the same fix. They could not be plants, or green, without their chloroplasts, which run the photosyn- thetic enterprise and generate oxygen for the rest ofus. As it turns out, chloroplasts are also separate creatures with their own genomes, speaking their own language. We carry stores of DNA in our nuclei that may have comein,atonetimeoranother,from thefusionofancestral cells and the linking of ancestral organisms in symbiosis.The Lives ofa Cell 5 Our genomes are catalogues of instructions from all kinds ofsources in nature, filed for all kinds ofcontingencies. As for me, I am grateful for differentiation and speciation, but I cannot feel as separate an entity as I did a few years ago, before I was told these things, nor, I should think, can anyone else. Item. The uniformity ofthe earth's life, more astonishing than itsdiversity, is accountable by the highprobability that we derived, originally, from some single cell, fertilized in aboltoflightningastheearthcooled. Itisfromtheprogeny ofthisparentcellthatwetakeourlooks;westillsharegenes around, and the resemblance of the enzymes ofgrasses to those of whales is a family resemblance. The viruses, instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death, now begin to look more like mobile genes. Evolution is still an infinitely long and tedious bi- ologicgame, with only the winners staying at the table, but the rules are beginning to look more flexible. We live in a dancing matrix ofviruses; they dart, rather like bees, from organismtoorganism,fromplanttoinsecttomammaltome and backagain,and intothesea, tuggingalongpiecesofthis genome, strings ofgenes from that, transplanting grafts of DNA, passing around heredity as though at a great party. They may be a mechanism for keeping new, mutant kinds DNA of in the widest circulation among us. Ifthis is true, the odd virus disease, on which we must focus so much of ourattention in medicine, may be looked on as an accident, something dropped. Item. I have been trying to think ofthe earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think ofit this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part ofsouthern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell.Thoughts for a Countdown Thereis ambiguity, and somesymbolism, in theelabo- rate ritual observed by each returning expedition of astronauts from the moon. They celebrate first ofall the inviolability of the earth, and they re-enact, each time, in stereotyped choreography, our long anxiety about the natureoflife. Theydo not, asone mightexpect, fall to their knees and kiss the carrier deck; this would violate, intrude upon, contaminate the deck, the vessel, the sea around, the whole earth. Instead, they wear surgical masks. They walk briskly, arms up, untouching, into a sterile box. They wave enigmatically,gnotobiotically, tothe Presidentfrom behind glass panes, soas notto breathe moonduston him. Theyare levitated toanothersealed boxin Houston, towaitouttheir days in quarantine, while inoculated animals and tissues cultures are squinted at for omens. It is only after the long antiseptic ceremony has been completed that they are allowed out into the sun, for the ride up Broadway. A visitor from anotherplanet, oranother century, would view the exercise as precisely lunatic behavior, but no one from outside would understand it. We must do things this way, these days. If there should be life on the moon, we must begin by fearing it. We must guard against it, lest we catch something. It might be a microbe, a strand of lost nucleic acid, a molecule ofenzyme, oranameless hairless little being with 6Thoughtsfor a Countdown 1 sharp gray eyes. Whatever, once we have imagined it, for- eign and therefore hostile, it is not to be petted. It must be locked up. I imagine the debate would turn on how best to kill it. It is remarkable that we have all accepted this, without hooting, as though it simply conformed to a law ofnature. It says something about our century, our attitude toward life, our obsession with disease and death, our human chauvinism. There are pieces of evidence that we have had it the wrong way round. Most of the associations between the living things we know about are essentially cooperative ones, symbiotic in one degree or another; when they have the look ofadversaries, it is usually astandoffrelation, with one party issuing signals, warnings, flagging the other off. It takes long intimacy, long and familiar interliving, before one kind of creature can cause illness in another. If there were to be life on the moon, it would have a lonely time waitingforacceptancetomembershiphere. Wedonothave solitary beings. Every creature is, in some sense, connected to and dependent on the rest. It has been estimated that we probably have real knowl- edgeofonlyasmallproportionofthemicrobesoftheearth, because mostofthem cannot be cultivated alone. They live together in dense, interdependent communities, feeding and supporting the environment for each other, regulating the balance of populations between different species by a complex system ofchemical signals. With our present tech- nology, we can no more isolate one from the rest, and rear it alone, than we can keep a single bee from drying up like a desquamated cell when removed from his hive. The bacteria are beginning to have the aspect of social animals; they should provide nice models for the study of interactions between forms oflife at all levels. They live by collaboration,accommodation,exchange, and barter. They,. 8 The Lives ofa Cell and the fungi, probably with help from a communication system laid on by the viruses, comprise the parenchyma of the soil (someone has suggested that humic acid, to which the microbes contribute, is a sort of counterpart for the ground substance ofour own connective tissue). They live on each other. Sometimes they live inside each other; the Bdellovibrio penetrate the walls ofother bacteria, tuck them- selves up inside, replicate, and burst out again as though they thought themselves phages. Some microbial communi- ties extend so deeply into the affairs ofhigher forms oflife astoseemlikenewkindsoftissueinplantsandanimals. The rhizobial bacteria that swarm over the root hairs oflegumi- nous plants have the look ofvoracious, invasive pathogens, but the root nodules that they then construct, in collabora- tion with the plant cells, become the earth's chieforgan for nitrogen fixation. The production ofleghemoglobin in the membrane-lined space between plant and bacterial cells is anexampleofthe high technologyofsymbiosis; theprotein issynthesized bytheplant, butonlyon instructionsfromthe DNA bacteria, and it is possible that the plant for coding thissubstancecameoriginallyfrom themicrobe,earlyinthe evolution of the arrangement. The bacteria that live in the tissues of insects, like those incorporated into the mycetocytes ofcockroaches and ter- mites, have the appearance of specialized organs in their hosts. It is notyetclear what they accomplish for the insect, but it is known that the species cannot survive long without them. They are transmitted, like mitochondria, fromgener- ation to generation of eggs. It has been proposed that symbiotic linkages between prokaryotic cells were the origin of eukaryotes, and that fusion between different sorts of eukaryotes (e.g., motile, ciliated cells joined to phagocyticones) led to the construc- tion of the communities that eventually turned out to be metazoan creatures. If this is true, the marks of identity,Thoughtsfor a Countdown 9 distinguishing self from non-self, have long since been blurred. Today, in the symbiotic associations that dominate so much of the life of the sea, there is rarely a question of who is who, even when the combination functions like a single animal. The anemones that fasten themselves to the shells, even to the claws, of certain crabs are capable of recognizing precisely the molecular configurations that identify those surfaces: the crab, for his part, can recognize his own anemone, and will sometimes seek him out and attach him to the shell like an ornament. The damsel fish that have become, from their point of view, functioning parts ofcertain species ofanemones adapt themselves when very young to life among the lethal tentacles oftheir host; — they cannot just swim in forthwith they must dart around the edges until labeled at their surfaces by markers accept- able to the anemone. Sometimes, in the course of the modulation of relations between animals, there are inventions that seem to have been thought up on the spur ofthe moment, like proposi- tionstobesubmittedforpossibleevolution. Somearegood- humored, even witty. Certain Australian surf bathers, sev- eral years ago, were stung by tiny creatures that turned out to be nudibranchs armed with the stingers of Portuguese men-of-war. Having fed on jellyfish, the Glaucus commu- nity had edited their meal and allowed the stinging cells to make their way to the surface oftheir new host, thus creat- ing, for the time, a sort ofinstant hybrid with, allowing for some asymmetry, the essential attributes of each partner. Even when circumstances require that there be winners and losers, the transaction is not necessarily a combat. The aloofness displayed for each other by members of the ma- rine coelenterate species of Gorgonaceae suggests that mechanisms for preserving individuality must have existed long before the evolution of immunity. The gorgonians tend to grow in closely packed, branching masses, but they10 The Lives ofa Cell do not fuse to each other; ifthey did, their morphogenesis would doubtlessbecomeashambles. Theodor, inaseriesof elegant experiments, has shown that when two individuals ofthe same species are placed in close contact, the smaller of the two will always begin to disintegrate. It is autode- struction due to lytic mechanisms entirely under thegover- nance of the smaller partner. He is not thrown out, not outgamed, not outgunned; he simply chooses to bow out. It is not necessarily a comfort to know that such things go on in biology, but it is at least an agreeable surprise. The oxygen in the atmosphere is the exhalation of the chloroplasts living inplants(also, forouramazement, in the siphons of giant clams and lesser marine animals). It is a natural tendency for genetically unrelated cells in tissue culture to come together, ignoring species differences, and fuse to form hybrid cells. Inflammation and immunology must indeed be powerfully designed to keep us apart; with- out such mechanisms, involving considerable effort, we might have developed as a kind offlowing syncytium over the earth, without the morphogenesis of even a flower. Perhaps we will find it possible to accommodate other forms oflife, from other planets, out ofsheergood nature. We are, after all, a planet where the rain contains vitamin B12! There is enough of it, by Parker's calculation, when convective windstorms occur at the time offarmland culti- vation and swirl it from the soil into the upperatmosphere, to produce a visible bloom ofEuglena in a fair-sized pond.On Societies as Organisms Viewed from a suitable height, the aggregating clus- ters ofmedical scientists in the bright sunlightofthe boardwalk at Atlantic City, swarmed there from everywhere for the annual meetings, have the look of as- semblages of social insects. There is the same vibrating, ionic movement, interrupted by the darting back and forth of jerky individuals to touch antennae and exchange small bits of information; periodically, the mass casts out, like a trout-line, a long single file unerringly toward Childs's. If the boards were not fastened down, it would not be a sur- prise to see them put together a nest of sorts. It is permissible to say this sort of thing about humans. They do resemble, in their mostcompulsively social behav- ior, ants at a distance. It is, however, quite bad form in biologicalcircles toputittheotherwayround, toimplythat the operation of insect societies has any relation at all to human affairs. The writers ofbooks on insect behaviorgen- erally takepains, in theirprefaces, tocaution thatinsectsare like creatures from another planet, that their behavior is absolutelyforeign, totallyunhuman,unearthly,almostunbi- ological. They are more likeperfectly tooled butcrazy little machines, and we violate science when we try to read hu- man meanings in their arrangements. It is hard for a bystander not to do so. Ants are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies into wars, use 1112 The Lives ofa Cell chemical sprays to alarm and confuse enemies, capture slaves. The families of weaver ants engage in child labor, holding their larvae like shuttles to spin out the thread that sews the leaves together for their fungus gardens. They exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watch television. What makes us most uncomfortable is that they, and the bees and termites and social wasps, seem to live two kinds oflives: they are individuals, goingabout theday's business without much evidence ofthought for tomorrow, and they are at the same time component parts, cellular elements, in the huge, writhing, ruminating organism of the Hill, the nest, the hive. It is because of this aspect, I think, that we mostwish forthem to be somethingforeign. Wedonotlike the notion that there can be collective societies with the capacity to behave like organisms. Ifsuch things exist, they can have nothing to do with us. Still, there it is. A solitary ant, afield, cannot be consid- ered to have much of anything on his mind; indeed, with only a few neurons strung together by fibers, he can't be imagined to have a mind at all, much less a thought. He is more like a ganglion on legs. Four ants together, or ten, encircling a dead moth on a path, begin to look more like an idea. Theyfumbleand shove,graduallymovingthefood toward the Hill, but as though by blind chance. It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, thatyou begin tosee thewhole beast, and now you observe itthinking,planning,calculating. Itisanintelligence, akind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits. At a stage in the construction, twigs ofa certain size are needed, and all the members forageobsessivelyfortwigsof just this size. Later, when outer walls are to be finished, thatched, the size must change, and as though given new orders by telephone, all the workers shift the search to theOn Societies as Organisms 13 new twigs. Ifyou disturb the arrangement ofa part of the Hill, hundreds ofants will set it vibrating, shifting, until it is put right again. Distant sources of food are somehow sensed, and long lines, like tentacles, reach out over the ground, up over walls, behind boulders, to fetch it in. Termites are even more extraordinary in the way they seem to accumulate intelligence as they gather together. Two or three termites in a chamber will begin to pick up pellets and move them from place to place, but nothing comes ofit; nothing is built. As more join in, they seem to reach a critical mass, a quorum, and the thinking begins. They place pellets atop pellets, then throw up columns and beautiful, curving, symmetrical arches, and the crystalline architecture ofvaulted chambers is created. It is not known how they communicate with each other, how the chains of termites building one column know when to turn toward the crew on the adjacent column, or how, when the time comes, they manage the flawless joining ofthe arches. The stimuli that set them offat the outset, building collectively instead of shifting things about, may be pheromones released when they reach committee size. They react as if alarmed. They become agitated, excited, and then they be- gin working, like artists. Bees live lives oforganisms, tissues, cells, organelles, all at the same time. The single bee, out ofthe hive retrieving sugar (instructed by the dancer: \"south-southeast for seven — hundred meters, clover mind you make corrections for the sundrift\") is still as much apartofthe hiveas ifattached by a filament. Building the hive, the workers have the look of embryonic cells organizing a developing tissue; from a distance they are like the viruses inside a cell, running off row after row of symmetrical polygons as though laying down crystals. When the time for swarming comes, and the old queen prepares to leavewith herpartofthepopulation, it is as though the hive were involved in mitosis. There is14 The Lives ofa Cell an agitated moving ofbees back and forth, like granules in cell sap. They distribute themselves in almost precisely equalparts,halftothedepartingqueen, halftothenewone. Thus, like an egg, the great, hairy, black and golden crea- ture splits in two, each with an equal share of the family genome. The phenomenon ofseparate animals joining up to form an organism is not unique in insects. Slime-mold cells do it all the time, of course, in each life cycle. At first they are single amebocytes swimming around, eating bacteria, aloof from each other, untouching, voting straight Republican. Then, a bell sounds, and acrasin is released by special cells toward which the others converge in stellate ranks, touch, fuse together, and construct the slug, solid as a trout. A splendid stalk is raised, with afruiting body on top, and out of this comes the next generation ofamebocytes, ready to swim across the same moistground, solitary and ambitious. Herring and other fish in schools are at times so closely integrated, their actions so coordinated, that they seem to be functionally a great multi-fish organism. Flocking birds, especially the seabirds nesting on the slopes of offshore islandsinNewfoundland, aresimilarlyattached,connected, synchronized. Although we are by all odds the most social ofall social — animals more interdependent, more attached to each — other, more inseparable in our behavior than bees we do not often feel our conjoined intelligence. Perhaps, how- ever, we are linked in circuits for the storage, processing, and retrieval of information, since this appears to be the most basicand universalofall human enterprises. It may be We our biological function to build a certain kind ofHill. have access to all the information ofthe biosphere, arriving aselementaryunitsinthestreamofsolarphotons.

The circuitry seems to be there, even ifthe current is notalways on. The system of communications used in science should provideaneat, workablemodel forstudyingmechanismsof information-building in human society. Ziman, in a recent Nature essay, points out, \"the invention ofamechanism for the systematic publication of fragments of scientific work may well have been the key event in the history ofmodern He science.\". continues: A regular journal carries from one research worker to another the various . . . observations which are ofcommon interest. . . .

With some alternation of terms, some toning down, the passage could describe the building of a termite nest. It is fascinating that the word \"explore\" does not apply to the searching aspect ofthe activity, but has its origins in the sounds we make while engaged in it. We like to think ofexploring in science as a lonely, meditative business, and so it is in the first stages, but always, sooner or later, before the enterprise reaches completion, as weexplore, we call to eachother, communicate,publish, send letterstotheeditor, present papers, cry out on finding.— A Fear of f hatarewegoingtodoifitturnsoutthatwehave pheromones? Whaton earth would we be doing with such things? With the richness of speech, and all our new devices forcommunication, why would we want to release odors into the air to convey information about anything? We can send notes, telephone, whisper cryptic invitations, announce the giving of parties, even bounce words offthe moon and make them carom around the planets. Why agas, or droplets ofmoisture made to be deposited on fence posts? Comfort has recently reviewed the reasons for believing that we are, in fact, in possession ofanatomic structures for which there is no rational explanation except as sources of — pheromones tufts of hair, strategically located apocrine glands, unaccountable areas of moisture. We even have folds of skin here and there designed for the controlled nurture of bacteria, and it is known that certain microbes eke out a living, like eighteenth-century musicians, produc- ing chemical signals by ornamenting the products of their hosts. Most of the known pheromones are small, simple mole- cules, active in extremely smallconcentrations. Eightorten carbon atoms in a chain are all that are needed to generate precise, unequivocal directions about all kinds ofmatters whenandwheretoclusterincrowds,whentodisperse,how to behave to the opposite sex, how to ascertain what is the 16A Fear ofPkeromones 17 opposite sex, how to organize members ofa society in the properrankingordersofdominance, how tomarkoutexact boundaries of real estate, and how to establish that one is, beyond argument, one's self. Trails can be laid and fol- lowed, antagonists frightened and confused, friends at- tracted and enchanted. The messages are urgent, but they may arrive, for all we know, in a fragrance of ambiguity. \"At home, 4 p.m. to- day,\" says the female moth, and releases a briefexplosion of bombykol, a single molecule of which will tremble the hairsofany malewithin milesand send him drivingupwind in a confusion of ardor. But it is doubtful if he has an awareness ofbeing caught in an aerosol ofchemical attract- ant. On the contrary, he probably finds suddenly that it has become an excellent day, the weather remarkably bracing, the time appropriate for a bit ofexercise of the old wings, a brisk turn upwind. En route, traveling the gradient of bombykol, he notes thepresenceofothermales, headingin the same direction, all in agood mood, inclined to race for the sheersportofit. Then, when he reaches his destination, it may seem to him the most extraordinary ofcoincidences, the greatest piece of luck: \"Bless my soul, what have we here!\" It has been soberly calculated that ifasingle female moth were to releaseall the bombykol in hersac in asingle spray, all at once, she could theoretically attract a trillion males in the instant. This is, of course, not done. Fish make use ofchemical signals for the identification of individual members ofaspecies, and also for the announce- mentofchanges in thestatusofcertain individuals. Acatfish that has had a career as a local leader smells one way, but as soon as he is displaced in an administrative reorganiza- tion, he smellsdifferently, and everyone recognizes the loss ofstanding. A bullhead can immediately identify the water in which a recentadversary has been swimming, and he can18 The Lives ofa Cell distinguish between this fish and all others in the school. There is some preliminary, still fragmentaryevidence for important pheromones in primates. Short-chain aliphatic compounds are elaborated by female monkeys in response to estradiol, and these are of consuming interest to the males. Whether there are other sorts ofsocial communica- tion by pheromones among primates is not known. Thepossibilitythathuman beingsareinvolved inthissort of thing has not attracted much attention until recently. It isstilltooearly tosayhowitwillcomeout. Perhapswehave inherited only vestiges ofthe organs needed, only antique and archaic traces ofthe fragrance, and the memory may be forevergone. We may remain safe from this new challenge to our technology, and, while the twentieth century contin- ues to run out in concentric circles down the drain, we may be able to keep our attention concentrated on how to get energy straight from the sun. But there are just the slightest suggestions, hints ofwhat may be ahead. Last year it was observed that young women living at close quarters in dormitories tended to undergo A spontaneous synchronization of their menstrual cycles. paper in Nature reported the personal experience of an anonymous, quantitatively minded British scientist who lived for long stretches in isolation on an offshore island, and discovered, by taking the dry weight of the hairs trapped by his electric razor every day, that his beard grew much more rapidly each time he returned to the mainland and encountered girls. Schizophrenic patients are reported to have a special odor to their sweat, traced to trans-3- methylhexanoic acid. The mind, already jelled by theadvances in moderncom- munication so that further boggling is impossible, twitches. One can imagine whole new industries springing up to create new perfumes (\"A Scientific Combination ofPrimer and Releaser\"), and other, larger corporations raising new turrets with flames alightattheirtops on theJersey flats, forA Fear ofPheromones 19 the production of phenolic, anesthetic, possibly bright green sprays to cover, mask, or suppress all pheromones (\"Don't Let On\"). Gas chromatography of air samples mightrevealblipsofdifferencebetweensubstancesreleased over a Glasgow football match, a committee meeting on academic promotions, and a summer beach on Saturday afternoon, all highly important. One can even imagine agi- tated conferences in the Pentagon, new agreements in Ge- neva. Itisclaimed thatawell-trained trackinghound can follow withaccuracythetrailofamaninshoes,acrossopenground marked by the footsteps of any number of other people, provided the dog is given an item ofthe man's clothing to smell beforehand. Ifone had to think up an R&D program for a National Institute ofHuman Fragrance (to be created bycombiningthe budgetsoftheFDA and FCC), thiswould be a good problem to start with. It might also provide the kind ofsecondary, spin-off items of science that we like to seeinfederallysupported research. Ifitistrue,asthenovels say, that an intelligent dog can tell the difference between one human being and any other by detecting differences in their scents, an explanation might be geometric differences in 10-carbon molecules, or perhaps differences in the rela- tive concentrations of several pheromones in a medley. If this is a fact, it should be of interest to the immunologic community, which has long since staked out claims on the mechanismsinvolved inthediscrimination betweenselfand non-self. Perhaps the fantastically sensitive and precise im- munologic mechanisms forthedetection ofsmall molecules such as haptenes represent another way ofsensing the same markers. Man's best friend might be used to sniff out his- tocompatibledonors. And so forth. Ifwecould justsucceed in maintaining the research activity at this level, perhaps diverting everyone's attention from all other aspects by releasinglargequantitiesofmoney, wemightbeabletostay out of trouble.Musk The of This Sphere t is one of our problems that as we become crowded together, the sounds we make to each other, in our increasingly complex communication systems, become more random-sounding, accidental or incidental, and we have trouble selecting meaningful signals out ofthe noise. Onereason is,ofcourse, thatwedonotseemabletorestrict our communication to information-bearing, relevant sig- nals. Given any new technology for transmitting informa- tion, we seem bound to use it for great quantities ofsmall talk. We are only saved by music from being overwhelmed by nonsense. It is a marginal comfort to know that the relatively new science of bioacoustics must deal with similar problems in the sounds made by otheranimals to each other. No matter what sound-making device is placed at their disposal, crea- tures in general do agreat deal ofgabbling, and it requires long patience and observation to edit out the parts lacking syntax and sense. Light social conversation, designed to keepthepartygoing,prevails. Natureabhorsalongsilence. Somewhere, underlying all the other signals, is a con- tinual music. Termites make percussive sounds to each other by beating their heads against the floor in the dark, resonating corridors of their nests. The sound has been described as resembling, to the human ear, sand falling on paper, but spectrographic analysis ofsound records has re- cently revealed a high degree oforganization in the drum- 20The Music ofThis Sphere 21 ming; thebeatsoccurin regular, rhythmicphrases,differing in duration, like notes for a tympani section. From time to time, certain termites make a convulsive movement of their mandibles to produce a loud, high- pitched clicking sound, audible ten meters off. So much effortgoes intothisone note thatitmusthaveurgentmean- ing, at least to the sender. He cannot make it without such awrench thathe is flungoneortwocentimeters into theair by the recoil. There is obvious hazard in trying to assign a particular meaningtothisspecialkindofsound,andproblemslikethis exist throughout the field ofbioacoustics. One can imagine a woolly-minded Visitor from Outer Space, interested in human beings, discerning on his spectrograph the click of that golf ball on the surface of the moon, and trying to account for it as a call of warning (unlikely), a signal of mating (out ofthe question), or an announcement ofterri- tory (could be). Bats are obliged to make sounds almost ceaselessly, to sense, by sonar, all the objects in their surroundings. They can spot with accuracy, on the wing, small insects, and they will home onto things they like with infallibility and speed. With such a system for the equivalent ofglancing around, they must live in a world of ultrasonic bat-sound, most of itwith an industrial, machinery sound. Still, theycommuni- cate with each other as well, by clicks and high-pitched greetings. Moreover, they have been heard to produce, while hanging at rest upside down in the depths ofwoods, strange, solitary, and lovely bell-like notes. Almost anything that an animal can employ to make a sound is put to use. Drumming, created by beating the feet, isused byprairiehens, rabbits,and mice; thehead isbanged by woodpeckers and certainotherbirds; the malesofdeath- watch beetles make a rapid ticking sound by percussion of a protuberance on the abdomen against the ground; a faint22 The Lives ofa Cell but audible ticking is made by the tiny beetle Lepinotus inquilinus, which is less than two millimeters in length. Fish make sounds byclicking theirteeth, blowingair, and drum- ming with special muscles against tuned inflated air blad- ders. Solid structures are set to vibrating by toothed bows incrustaceansand insects.Theproboscisofthedeath's-head hawk moth is used as a kind of reed instrument, blown through to make high-pitched, reedy notes. Gorillas beat their chests for certain kinds of discourse. Animals with loose skeletons rattle them, or, like rattle- snakes, get sounds from externally placed structures. Tur- tles, alligators, crocodiles, and even snakes make various more or less vocal sounds. Leeches have been heard to tap rhythmically on leaves, engaging the attention of other leeches, which tap back, in synchrony. Even earthworms make sounds, faint staccato notes in regular clusters. Toads sing toeach other, and their friends sing back in antiphony. Birdsong has been so much analyzed for its content of business communication that there seems little time left for music, but it is there. Behind theglossariesofwarningcalls, alarms, mating messages, pronouncementsofterritory, calls for recruitment, and demands for dispersal, there is redun- dant, elegant sound that is unaccountable as part of the working day. The thrush in my backyard sings down his nose in meditative, liquid runs of melody, over and over again, and I have the strongest impression that he does this for his own pleasure. Some of the time he seems to be practicing, like a virtuoso in his apartment. He starts a run, reaches amidpoint in the second barwhere there should be a set ofcomplex harmonics, stops, and goes back to begin over, dissatisfied. Sometimes he changes his notation so conspicuously that he seems to be improvising sets ofvaria- tions. It is a meditative, questioning kind of music, and I cannot believe that he is simply saying, \"thrush here.\" The robin sings flexible songs, containing a variety of— The Music ofThis Sphere 23 motifs that he rearranges to his liking; the notes in each motifconstitutethesyntax,and thepossibilitiesforvariation produce a considerable repertoire. The meadow lark, with threehundred notes toworkwith, arrangesthese inphrases ofthree to six notes and elaborates fifty types ofsong. The nightingale has twenty-four basicsongs, butgains wild vari- ety by varying the internal arrangement ofphrases and the length ofpauses. The chaffinch listens to other chaffinches, and incorporates into his memory snatches of their songs. The need to make music, and to listen to it, is universally expressed by human beings. I cannot imagine, even in our mostprimitive times, the emergence oftalented painters to make cave paintings without there having been, near at hand, equally creative people making song. It is, like speech, a dominant aspect of human biology. The individual parts played by other instrumentalists — crickets or earthworms, for instance may not have the sound of music by themselves, but we hear them out of context. Ifwe could listen to them all at once, fully orches- trated, in theirimmenseensemble, wemightbecomeaware of the counterpoint, the balance of tones and timbres and harmonics, thesonorities. The recorded songsofthe hump- backwhale, filled with tensionsand resolutions, ambiguities and allusions, incomplete, can be listened to as a part of music, like an isolated section of an orchestra. If we had better hearing, and could discern the descants ofsea birds, the rhythmic tympani of schools of mollusks, or even the distant harmonics of midges hanging over meadows in the sun, the combined sound might lift us off our feet. There are, ofcourse, other ways to account for the songs ofwhales. They might be simple, down-to-earth statements about navigation, or sources of krill, or limits of territory. But the proofis not in, and until it is shown that these long, convoluted, insistent melodies, repeated by different sing- ers with ornamentations of their own, are the means of24 The Lives ofa Cell sending through several hundred miles of undersea such ordinaryinformation as \"whale here,\" I shall believeother- wise. Now and again, in the intervals between songs, the whales have been seen to breach, leaping clear out of the sea and landing on their backs, awash in the turbulence of their beating flippers. Perhaps they are pleased by the way the piece went, orperhaps it is celebration at hearing one's ownsongreturningaftercircumnavigation; whatever, ithas the look of jubilation. I suppose that my extraterrestrial Visitor night puzzle over my records in much the same way, on first listening. The 14th Quartet might, for him, be a communication an- nouncing, \"Beethoven here,\" answered, after passage through an undersea of time and submerged currents of human thought, by another long signal a century later, \"Bartok here.\" If, as I believe, the urge to make a kind of music is as much a characteristic of biology as our other fundamental functions, there ought to be an explanation for it. Having none at hand, I am free to make one up. The rhythmic — sounds might be the recapitulation of something else an earliest memory, a score for the transformation of inani- mate, random matterin chaos intothe improbable, ordered dance ofliving forms. Morowitz has presented the case, in thermodynamic terms, for the hypothesis that a steady flow of energy from the inexhaustible source of the sun to the unreliable sink ofouter space, by way ofthe earth, is math- ematically destined to cause the organization ofmatter into an increasingly ordered state. The resulting balancing act involves a ceaseless clustering of bonded atoms into mole- cules ofhigher and higher complexity, and the emergence ofcyclesforthestorageand releaseofenergy. Inanonequi- librium steady state, which is postulated, the solar energy would not just flow to the earth and radiate away; it is thermodynamically inevitable that it must rearrange matterThe Music ofThis Sphere 25 into symmetry, away from probability, against entropy, lift- ing it, so to speak, into a constantly changing condition of rearrangement and molecularornamentation. In such a sys- tem, the outcome is a chancy kind oforder, always on the vergeofdescendingintochaos, held tautagainstprobability by the unremitting, constant surge ofenergy from the sun. Ifthere were to be sounds to represent this process, they would havethearrangementoftheBrandenburgConcertos for my ear, but I am open to wonder whether the same events are recalled by the rhythms of insects, the long, pulsing runs ofbirdsong, the descants ofwhales, the modu- lated vibrations of a million locusts in migration, the tym- pani ofgorilla breasts, termite heads, drumfish bladders. A \"grand canonical ensemble\" is, oddly enough, the proper term for a quantitative model system in thermodynamics, borrowed from music by way of mathematics. Borrowed back again, provided with notation, it would do for what I have in mind.An Earnest Proposal There was a quarter-page advertisement in the Lon- don Observerforacomputerservicethatwillenmesh your name in an electronic network of fifty thou- sand other names, sort out your tastes, preferences, habits, and deepest desires and match them up with opposite num- bers, and retrieve for you, within a matter ofseconds, and for a very small fee, friends. \"Already,\" it says, \"it [the computer] has given very real happiness and lasting rela- tionships to thousands ofpeople, and itcan do the same for you!\" Withoutpaying afee, or filling outaquestionnaire, all of us are being linked in similar circuits, for other reasons, by credit bureaus, the census, the tax people, the local police station, or the Army. Sooner or later, if it keeps on, the variousnetworkswillbegintotouch,fuse,andthen,intheir coalescence, they will start sorting and retrieving each other, and we will all become bits of information on an enormous grid. I do not worry much about the computers that are wired to help me find a friend among fifty thousand. Iferrors are made, I can always begoffwith aheadache. Butwhatofthe vaster machines that will be giving instructions to cities, to nations? Ifthey are programmed to regulate human behav- ioraccording to today's viewofnature, weare surely in for apocalypse. The men who run the affairs ofnations today are, by and 26An Earnest Proposal 27 large, our practical men. They have been taught that the world is an arrangement ofadversary systems, that force is what counts, aggression is what drives us at the core, only thefittestcansurvive,andonlymightcanmakemoremight. Thus, it is in observance of nature's law that we have planted, likeperennialtubers, thenumberlessnamelessmis- siles in the soil of Russia and China and our Midwestern farmlands,withmoretocome,poisedtoflyoutatananosec- ond's notice, and meticulously engineered to ignite, in the centers ofall our cities, artificial suns. Ifwe let fly enough ofthem atonce, wecan even burn outtheone-celled green creatures in the sea, and thus turn off the oxygen. Before such things are done, one hopes that the comput- erswillcontainevery leastbitofrelevantinformationabout the way ofthe world. I should think we might assume this, in fairness to all. Even the nuclear realists, busy as their minds must be with calculations of acceptable levels of megadeath, would not want to overlook anything. They should be willing to wait, for a while anyway. I have an earnest proposal to make. I suggest that we defer further action until we have acquired a really com- pletesetofinformationconcerningatleastonelivingthing. Then, at least, we shall be able to claim that we know what we are doing. The delay might take a decade; let us say a We decade. and theothernationsmightsetitasanobjective ofinternational, collaborativescience toachieveacomplete understanding of a single form of life. When this is done, and the information programmed into all our computers, I for one would be willing to take my chances. As to the subject, I propose a simple one, easily solved within ten years. It is the protozoan Myxotricba paradoxa, which inhabits the inner reaches of the digestive tract of Australian termites. It is notas though we would be starting from scratch. We have a fair amount of information about this creature al-28 The Lives ofa Cell — ready not enough to understand him, of course, but enough to inform us that he means something, perhaps a great deal. At first glance, he appears to be an ordinary, motile protozoan, remarkable chiefly for the speed and di- rectness with which he swims from place toplace, engulfing fragments ofwood finely chewed by his termite host. In the termite ecosystem, an arrangement of Byzantine com- plexity, he stands at the epicenter. Without him, the wood, however finely chewed, would never get digested; he sup- plies the enzymes that break down cellulose to edible car- bohydrate, leaving only the nondegradable lignin, which the termite then excretes in geometrically tidy pellets and uses as building blocks for the erection ofarches and vaults in the termite nest. Without him there would be no ter- mites, no farms ofthe fungi that are cultivated by termites and will grow nowhere else, and no conversion of dead trees to loam. The flagellae that beat in synchrony topropel myxotricha with such directness turn out, on closer scrutiny with the electron microscope, not to be flagellae at all. They are outsiders, in to help with the business: fully formed, perfect spirochetes that have attached themselves at regularly spaced intervals all over the surface of the protozoan. Then, thereare oval organelles, embedded in the surface closetothepointofattachmentofthespirochetes,andother similarbodiesdrifting through thecytoplasm with theparti- cles ofstill undigested wood. These, under high magnifica- tion, turn out to be bacteria, living in symbiosis with the spirochetes and the protozoan, probably contributing en- zymes that break down the cellulose. Thewholeanimal, orecosystem, stuck forthe time being halfway along in evolution, appears to be a model for the development of cells like our own. Margulis has summa- rized the now considerable body ofdata indicating that the modern nucleated cell was made up, part by part, by theAn Earnest Proposal 29 coming togetherofjustsuchprokaryoticanimals. The blue- green algae, the original inventors of photosynthesis, en- tered partnership with primitive bacterial cells, and became the chloroplasts ofplants; their descendants remain as dis- crete separate animals inside plant cells, with their own DNA and RNA, replicating on their own. Other bacteria with oxidative enzymes in their membranes, makers of ATP, joined up with fermenting bacteria and became the mitochondriaofthefuture; they havesincedeleted someof their genes but retain personal genomes and can only be regarded as symbionts. Spirochetes, like the ones attached to M. paradoxa, joined upand becametheciliaofeukaryotic cells. Thecentrioles, which hoistthemicrotubulesonwhich chromosomes are strung for mitosis, are similar separate creatures; when not busy with mitosis, they become the basal bodies to which cilia are attached. And there are oth- ers, not yet clearly delineated, whose existence in the cell is indicated by the presence of cytoplasmic genes. There is an underlying force that drives together the several creatures comprising myxotricha, and, then drives the assemblage into union with the termite. If we could understand this tendency, we would catch a glimpse ofthe process that brought single separate cells together for the construction ofmetazoans, culminating in the invention of roses, dolphins, and, ofcourse, ourselves. It might turn out that the same tendency underlies the joining of organisms intocommunities,communitiesintoecosystems,andecosys- tems into the biosphere. Ifthis is, in fact, thedriftofthings, the way ofthe world, we may come to view immune reac- tions, genes for the chemical marking of self, and perhaps all reflexive responses ofaggression and defense as second- ary developments in evolution, necessary for the regulation and modulationofsymbiosis, notdesigned to breakinto the process, only to keep it from getting out of hand. Ifit is in the nature ofliving things to pool resources, to30 The Lives ofa Cell fusewhenpossible,wewould haveanewwayofaccounting for the progressive enrichment and complexity of form in living things. I take it on faith that computers, although lacking souls, are possessed of a kind of intelligence. At the end of the decade, therefore, I am willing to predict that the feeding inofalltheinformationthenavailablewillresult,afterafew seconds of whirring, in something like the following mes- sage, neatly and speedily printed out: \"Request more data. How are spirochetes attached? Do not fire.\"The Technology of Medicine Technology assessment has become a routine exer- cise forthe scientificenterprises on which thecoun- try is obliged to spend vast sums for its needs. Brainy committees are continually evaluating the effective- ness and cost of doing various things in space, defense, energy, transportation, and the like, to give advice about prudent investments for the future. Somehow medicine, for all the $80-odd billion that it is said to cost the nation, has not yet come in for much ofthis analytical treatment. It seems taken for granted that the technologyofmedicine simplyexists, take itorleave it, and the only major technologic problem which policy-makers are interested in is how to deliver today's kind of health care, with equity, to all the people. When, as is bound to happen sooneror later, the analysts get around to the technology of medicine itself, they will have to face the problem ofmeasuring the relative cost and effectiveness ofall the things that are done in the manage- mentofdisease. Theymaketheirlivingatthis kind ofthing, and I wish them well, but I imagine they will have a bewil- dering time. For one thing, our methods of managing dis- — ease are constantly changing partly under the influence of new bits of information brought in from all corners of bi- ologic science. At the same time, a great many things are done that are not so closely related to science, some not related at all. 3132 The Lives ofa Cell Infact, therearethreequitedifferentlevelsoftechnology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate. 1. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed \"nontechnology,\" impossible to measure in terms ofits capacity to altereither the natural course ofdisease or itseventualoutcome. Agreatdealofmoneyisspentonthis. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the pa- tients. It consists of what is sometimes called \"supportive therapy.\" Ittidespatientsoverthroughdiseasesthatarenot, by and large, understood. It is what is meant by the phrases \"caringfor\" and \"standingby.\" Itisindispensable. Itis not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It includes the large part ofany good doctor's time that is taken upwith simplyprovidingreassurance, explainingto patients who fear that they have contracted one or another lethal disease that they are, in fact, quite healthy. It is whatphysicians used to be engaged in at the bedside ofpatients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. Itiswhatphysicians mustnowdoforpatientswith intract- able cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective tech- nology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this cate- gory. The cost ofthis nontechnology is very high, and getting higherall the time. It requires notonly agreatdeal oftime but also very hard effort and skill on the part ofphysicians;The Technology ofMedicine 33 only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind ofdefeat. It also involves long periods of hospitaliza- tion, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of nonmedical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. Atthenextlevelupisakind oftechnologybesttermed \"halfway technology.\" This represents the kinds of things that must bedoneafterthe fact, inefforts tocompensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the trans- plantations ofhearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions ofartificial organs. In the public mind, this kind oftechnology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic tri- umph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and profoundly primitive. It is the kind ofthing that one mustcontinue to do until there is a genuine understanding ofthe mechanisms involved in disease. Inchronicglomerulonephritis,forexample,amuch clearer insightwill be needed into theevents leading to the destruction ofglomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn itround. Butwhen thislevelofunderstandinghasbeen reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longerpose the hugeproblems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. Anextremelycomplexandcostlytechnologyfortheman- — agement ofcoronary heart disease has evolved involving34 The Lives ofa Cell specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds ofelec- tronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional — personnel to deal with the end results ofcoronary throm- bosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the trans- planted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this hap- pens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side. Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represents halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence ofalready established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is acharacteristic ofthis kind oftechnology that itcosts an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion ofhospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care unitscanresultintheextensionoflifeforonlyafewpatients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact oflife that as many ofthese as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do notsee thatanyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this information is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective thatitseems toattractthe leastpublic notice; ithas come to be taken forgranted. This is thegenuinelydecisive technology ofmodern medicine, exemplified best by mod-The Technology ofMedicine 35 ern methods forimmunization againstdiphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virusdiseases, and thecontemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculo- sis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use ofthis potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endo- crinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the pre- vention ofhemolytic disease ofthe newborn, the treatment andpreventionofvariousnutritionaldisorders,andperhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle-cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there are nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. — Thepoint to be made about this kind oftechnology the — real high technology of medicine is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, relatively simple, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think ofany important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to pre- vent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of no-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, itwould run toastaggeringexpense. At, say, around fifty days ofhospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind ofnursing care, with the obsessive concern for details ofdietthatcharacterized thetherapyofthattime, withdaily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical interven- tion for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as con- trasted with today's cost ofa bottle ofchloramphenicol and36 The Lives ofa Cell a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolvingforpoliomyelitisintheearly 1950s, justbeforethe emergenceofthebasicresearchthatmadethevaccinepossi- ble, provides another illustration of the point. Do you remember Sister Kenny, and the cost ofthose institutes for rehabilitation, with all those ceremonially applied hot fomentations, and the debates about whether the affected limbs should be totally immobilized or kept in passive mo- tion as frequently as possible, and the masses ofstatistically tormenteddatamobilized tosupportoneviewortheother? It is the cost of that kind of technology, and its relative effectiveness, thatmustbecompared with thecostandeffec- tiveness of the vaccine. Pulmonary tuberculosis had similar episodes in its his- tory. There was a sudden enthusiasm for the surgical re- moval ofinfected lung tissue in the early 1950s, and elabo- rate plans were being made for new and expensive installations for major pulmonary surgery in tuberculosis hospitals, and then INH and streptomycin came along and the hospitals themselves were closed up. It is when physicians are bogged down by their incom- plete technologies, by the innumerable things they are obliged to do in medicine when they lack a clear under- standing ofdisease mechanisms, that the deficiencies ofthe health-care system are most conspicuous. IfI were apolicy- maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon.Vibes We leave traces of ourselves wherever we go, on whatever we touch. One of the odd discoveries made by small boys is that when two pebbles are strucksharplyagainsteachothertheyemit, briefly,acurious smoky odor. The phenomenon fades when the stones are immaculately cleaned, vanishes when they are heated to furnace temperature, and reappears when they are simply touched by the hand again before being struck. An intelligent dog with a good nose can track a man across open ground by his smell and distinguish that man's tracks from those of others. More than this, the dog can detect theodorofalight human fingerprinton aglass slide, and hewill rememberthatslideand smell itoutfromothers for as long as six weeks, when the scent fades away. More- over, this animal can smell the identity of identical twins, and willfollow the tracksofoneortheotheras though they had been made by the same man. We are marked as selfby the chemicals we leave beneath the soles ofour shoes, as unmistakably and individually as by the membrane surface antigensdetectable in homografts of our tissues. Other animals are similarly endowed with signaling mechanisms. Columns ofants can smell out the differences between themselves and other ants on their trails. The ants ofone species, proceeding jerkily across a path, leave trails that can be followed by their own relatives but not by oth- ers. Certain ants, predators, have taken unfair advantage of the system; they are born with an ability to sense the trails 3738 The Lives ofa Cell of the species they habitually take for slaves, follow their victims to their nests, and release special odorants that throw them into disorganized panic. Minnows and catfish can recognize each memberoftheir own species by hisparticular,person-specificodor. Itishard to imagine a solitary, independent, existentialist minnow, recognizable for himselfalone; minnows in aschool behave like interchangeable, identical parts of an organism. But there it is. The problem ofolfactory sensing shares some ofthe cur- rent puzzles and confusions ofimmunology, apart from the business of telling self from non-self. A rabbit, it has been calculated, has something like 100 million olfactory recep- tors. There is a constant and surprisingly rapid turnover of the receptor cells, with new ones emerging from basal cells within a few days. The theories to explain olfaction are as numerous and complex as those for immunologic sensing. Itseemslikelythattheshapeofthesmelled moleculeiswhat matters most. By and large, odorants are chemically small, Spartan compounds. In a rose garden, a rose is a rose be- cause of geraniol, a 10-carbon compound, and it is the geometricconformationofatomsand theirbondanglesthat determine the unique fragrance. The special vibrations of atoms orgroups ofatoms within the moleculesofodorants, or the vibratory song of the entire molecule, have been made the basis for several theories, with postulated \"osmic frequencies\" as the source of odor. The geometry of the molecule seems to be more importantthan the namesofthe atoms themselves; any set ofatoms, ifarranged in precisely the same configuration, by whatever chemical name, might smell as sweet. It is not known how the olfactory cells are fired by an odorant. According tooneview, ahole ispoked in the receptor membrane, launching depolarization, but other workers believe that the substance may become bound to the cells possessing specific receptors for it andVibes 39 then may just sit there, somehow displaying its signal from a distance, after the fashion of antigens on immune cells. Specific receptor proteins have been proposed, with differ- ent olfactory cells carrying specific receptors for different \"primary\" odors, but no one has yet succeeded in identify- ing the receptors or naming the \"primary\" odors. Training of cells for olfactory sensing appears to be an everyday phenomenon. Repeated exposure ofan animal to the same odorant, in small doses, leads to great enhance- ment ofacuity, suggesting the possibility that new receptor sites are added to the cells. Itis conceivable that new clones ofcells with a particular receptor are stimulated to emerge in theprocessoftraining. Theguineapig, thatimmunologi- cally famous animal, can be trained to perceive fantastically smallamountsofnitrobenzenebyhisnose, withoutthehelp of Freund's adjuvants or haptene carriers. Minnows have been trained to recognize phenol, and distinguish it from p-chlorophenol, in concentrations of five parts per billion. Eels have been taught to smell two or three molecules of phenylethyl alcohol. And, ofcourse, eels and salmon must beabletorememberbynature, as thephrasegoes, theodor ofthe waters in which they were hatched, soas tosnifftheir way back from theopen seaforspawning. Electrodes in the olfactory bulbs of salmon will fire when the olfactory epi- thelium is exposed to water from their spawning grounds, whereas water from other streams causes no response. Wefeel somehow inferiorand leftoutofthings byall the marvelous sensory technology in the creatures around us. We sometimes try to diminish our sense of loss (or loss of sense) byclaiming toourselves thatwe haveputsuch primi- tive mechanisms behind us in our evolution. We like to regard the olfactory bulb as a sort ofarcheologic find, and wespeakoftheancientolfactorypartsofthebrainasthough they were elderly, dotty relatives in need of hobbies. Butwe may be betteratit than we think. An average man40 The Lives ofa Cell candetectjustafewmoleculesofbutylmercaptan,and most of us can sense the presence of musk in vanishingly small amounts. Steroids are marvelously odorous, emitting varie- ties ofmusky, sexy smells. Women are acutely aware ofthe odor of a synthetic steroid named exaltolide, which most men are unable to detect. All of us are able to smell ants, for which the great word pismire was originally coined. There may even be odorants that fire offreceptors in our olfactory epithelia without our being conscious of smell, including signals exchanged involuntarily between human beings. Wiener has proposed, on intuitive grounds, that defects and misinterpretations in such acommunication sys- tem may be an unexplored territory for psychiatry. The schizophrenic, he suggests, may have his problems with identityand realitybecauseofflawedperceptionsofhisown or others' signals. And, indeed, there may be something wrong with the apparatus in schizophrenics; they have, it is said, an unfamiliar odor, recently attributed to trans-3- methylhexanoic acid, in their sweat. Olfactoryreceptors forcommunication betweendifferent creaturesare crucial for the establishmentofsymbiotic rela- tions. The crab and anemone recognize each other as part- ners by molecular configurations, as do the anemones and their symbiotic damsel fish. Similar devices are employed for defense, as with the limpet, which defends itselfagainst starfishpredators byevertingits mantleand thusprecluding a starfish foothold; the limpet senses a special starfish pro- tein, which is, perhaps in the name of fairness, elaborated by all starfish into their environment. The system is evi- dently an ancient one, long antedating the immunologic sensingoffamiliarorforeign formsoflife by theantibodies on which we now depend so heavily for our separateness. It has recently been learned that the genes for the marking of self by cellular antigens and those for making im- munologic responses by antibody formation are closelyVibes 41 linked. Itispossiblethattheinventionofantibodiesevolved from the earlier sensing mechanisms needed for symbiosis, perhaps designed, in part, to keep the latter from getting out of hand. A very general system of chemical communication be- tween living things ofall kinds, plant and animal, has been termed \"allelochemics\" by Whittaker. Using one signal or another, each form of life announces its proximity to the others around it, setting limits on encroachment or spread- ing welcome to potential symbionts. The net effect is a coordinated mechanism for the regulation of rates of growthandoccupationsofterritory. Itisevidentlydesigned for the homeostasis of the earth. Jorge Borges, in his recent bestiaryofmythical creatures, notes that the idea of round beasts was imagined by many speculative minds, and Johannes Kepler once argued that the earth itself is such a being. In this immense organism, chemical signals might serve the function of global hor- mones, keeping balance and symmetry in the operation of various interrelated working parts, informing tissues in the vegetation oftheAlps aboutthestateofeels in theSargasso Sea, by long, interminable relays of interconnected mes- sages between all kinds of other creatures. This is an interesting kind ofproblem, made to order for computers if they came in sizes big enough to store in nearby galaxies. It is nice to think that there are so many unsolved puzzles ahead for biology, although I wonder whether we will ever find enough graduate students.(Vp Tau Ceti is a relatively nearby star that sufficiently resembles our sun to make its solar system aplausi- We ble candidate for the existence of life. are, it appears, ready to begingetting in touch withCeti, and with any other interested celestial body in more remote places, out to the edge. CETI is also, by intention, the acronym of the First International Conference on Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence, held in 1972 in Soviet Ar- meniaunderthejointsponsorshipoftheNationalAcademy of Sciences of the United States and the Soviet Academy which involved eminent physicists and astronomers from various countries, most of whom are convinced that the odds for the existence oflife elsewhere are very high, with a reasonable probability that there are civilizations, one place or another, with technologic mastery matching or exceeding ours. On this assumption, the conferees thought it likely that radioastronomy would be the generally accepted mode of interstellar communication, on grounds of speed and economy. They made a formal recommendation that we organize an international cooperative program, with new and immenseradio telescopes, toprobe the reachesofdeep space forelectromagnetic signals making sense. Eventually, wewouldplantosendoutmessagesonourownandreceive answers, but at the outset it seems more practical to begin by catching snatches of conversation between others. So, the highest of all our complex technologies in the hardest ofour sciences will soon be engaged, full scale, in 42Ceti 43 — whatisessentially biologicresearch and withsomeaspects of social science, at that. The earth has become, just in the last decade, too small — We a place. have the feeling ofbeing confined shut in; it issomethinglikeoutgrowingasmall town inasmallcounty. The views ofthe dark, pocked surface ofMars, still lifeless to judge from the latest photographs, do not seem to have extended our reach; instead, they bring closer, too close, another unsatisfactory feature of our local environment. The blue noonday sky, cloudless, has lost its old look of immensity. The word is out that the sky is not limitless; it is finite. Itis, in truth, onlyakind oflocal roof, amembrane under which we live, luminous but confusingly refractile when suffused with sunlight; we can sense its concave sur- face a few miles over our heads. We know that it is tough and thick enough so that when hard objects strike it from theoutsidetheyburstintoflames. Thecolorphotographsof the earth are more amazing than anything outside: we live inside a blue chamber, a bubble ofair blown by ourselves. The other sky beyond, absolutely black and appalling, is wide-open country, irresistible for exploration. Here wego, then. An extraterrestrial embryologist, hav- ing a close look at us from time to time, would probably conclude that the morphogenesis of the earth is coming along well, with the beginnings of a nervous system and fair-sized ganglions in the form of cities, and now with specialized, dish-shaped sensory organs, miles across, ready to receive stimuli. He may well wonder, however, how we willgoaboutresponding. Weareevolvingintothesituation ofa Skinner pigeon in a Skinner box, peering about in all directions, trying to make connections, probing. When the first word comes in from outer space, finally, we will probably be used to the idea. We can already pro- vide aquite good explanation for the origin oflife, here or elsewhere. Given a moist planet with methane, formalde-44 The Lives ofa Cell hyde, ammonia, and some usable minerals, all of which abound, exposed to lightning or ultraviolet irradiation at the right temperature, life might start offalmost anywhere. The tricky, unsolved thing is how to get the polymers to arrange in membranes and invent replication. The rest is cleargoing. Ifthey followourprotocol, itwill be anaerobic life at first, then photosynthesis and the first exhalation of oxygen, then respiring life and the great burst ofvariation, then speciation, and, finally, some kind ofconsciousness. It is easy, in the telling. I suspect that when we have recovered from the firsteasy acceptance of signs of life from elsewhere, and finished nodding at each other, and finished smiling, we will be in We for shock. have had it our way, relatively speaking, being unique all these years, and itwill be hard todeal with the thought that the whole, infinitely huge, spinning, clock- likeapparatus around us is itselfanimate, and cansproutlife whenever the conditions are right. We will respond, beyond doubt, by making connections after the fashion of established life, floating out our filaments^ extending pili, but we will end up feeling smaller than ever, as small as a single cell, with aquite new sense ofcontinuity. It will take some getting used to. Theimmediateproblem, however, isamuch morepracti- cal, down-to-earth matter, and must be giving insomnia to the CETI participants. Let us assume that there is, indeed, sentientlifeinoneoranotherpartofremotespace, and that we will be successful in getting in touch with it. What on earth are we going to talk about? If, as seems likely, it is a hundred or more light years away, there are going to be some very long pauses. The barest amenities, on which we — rely for opening conversations Hello, are you there?, — from us, followed by Yes, hello, from them will take two hundred years at least. By the time we have our party we may have forgotten what we had in mind. We could begin by gambling on the Tightness of ourCeti 45 technology and just send out news of ourselves, like a mimeographed Christmas letter, but we would have to choose our items carefully, with durability of meaning in mind. Whatever information we provide must still make sense to us two centuries later, and must still seem impor- tant, or the conversation will be an embarrassment to all concerned. In two hundred years it is, as we have found, easy to lose the thread. Perhaps the safest thing to do at the outset, iftechnology permits, is to send music. This language may be the bestwe haveforexplainingwhatweare like toothers in space, with leastambiguity. IwouldvoteforBach,allofBach,streamed outintospace, overandoveragain. Wewould be bragging, of course, but it is surely excusable for us to put the best possible face on at the beginning of such an acquaintance. We can tell the harder truths later. And, to do ourselves justice, music would give a fairer picture of what we are really like than some ofthe other things we might be send- ing, like Time, say, or a history ofthe U.N. or Presidential We speeches. could send outourscience, ofcourse, butjust think ofthe wincing at this end when the polite comments arrive two hundred years from now. Whatever we offer as today's itemsofliveliestinterestarebound to beoutofdate and irrelevant, maybe even ridiculous. I think we should stick to music. Perhaps, ifthetechnologycan beadapted to it, weshould send some paintings. Nothing would better describe what this place is like, to an outsider, than the Cezanne demon- strations that an apple is really part fruit, part earth. What kinds ofquestions should we ask? The choices will be hard, and everyone will want his special question first. What are your smallest particles? Did you think yourselves unique? Do you have colds? Have you anything quicker than light? Do you always tell the truth? Do youcry?There is no end to the list. Perhaps we should wait a while, until we are sure we46 The Lives ofa Cell know what we want to know, before we get down to de- tailed questions. After all, the main question will be the opener: Hello, are you there? If the reply should turn out to be Yes, hello, we might want to stop there and think about that, for quite a long time.The Long Habit We continue to share with our remotest ancestors the most tangled and evasive attitudes about death, despite the great distance we have come in understanding some ofthe profound aspects of biology. We have as much distaste for talking about personal death as for thinking about it; it is an indelicacy, like talking in mixed company about venereal disease or abortion in the old days. Death on a grand scale does not bother us in the same special way: we can sit around a dinner table and discuss war, involving 60 million volatilized human deaths, as though we were talkingaboutbad weather; wecan watch abrupt bloodydeath everyday, in color, on filmsand televi- sion, without blinking back a tear. It is when the numbers ofdeadareverysmall,andveryclose, thatwebegin tothink in scurryingcircles. At the very centerofthe problem is the naked cold deadness of one's own self, the only reality in nature of which we can have absolute certainty, and it is unmentionable, unthinkable. We may be even less willing to face the issue at first hand than our predecessors because ofa secret new hope that maybe it will go away. We like to think, hiding the thought, that with all the marvelous ways in which we seem now to lead nature around by the nose, perhapswecanavoid thecentralproblem ifwejustbecome, next year, say, a bit smarter. \"The long habit ofliving,\" said Thomas Browne, \"indis- poseth us to dying.\" These days, the habit has become an 4748 The Lives ofa Cell addiction: we are hooked on living; the tenacity ofits grip on us, and ours on it, grows in intensity. We cannot think — ofgiving it up, even when living loses its zest even when we have lost the zest for zest. We have come a long way in our technologic capacity to putdeathoff,and itisimaginablethatwemightlearn tostall it for even longer periods, perhaps matching the life-spans ofthe Abkhasian Russians, who are said togoon, springily, for a century and a half. Ifwe can rid ourselves ofsome of ourchronic, degenerative diseases, and cancer, strokes, and coronaries, we mightgoon and on. Itsounds attractive and reasonable, but it is no certainty. If we became free of disease, we would make a much better run ofit for the last decade or so, but might still terminate on about the same schedule as now. We may be like the genetically different linesofmice,orlike Hayflick'sdifferenttissue-culturelines, programmed to die after a predetermined number ofdays, clocked by theirgenomes. Ifthis is the way it is, some ofus will continue to wear out and come unhinged in the sixth decade, and some much later, depending on genetic time- tables. If we ever do achieve freedom from most of today's diseases, or even complete freedom from disease, we will perhaps terminate by drying out and blowing away on a light breeze, but we will still die. Most ofmy friends do not like this way oflooking at it. They prefer to take it for granted that we only die because we get sick, with one lethal ailment or another, and \\i we did nothaveourdiseases we mightgoon indefinitely. Even biologistschoose to thinkthisaboutthemselves, despite the evidences of the absolute inevitability of death that sur- round their professional lives. Everything dies, all around, trees, plankton, lichens, mice, whales, flies, mitochondria. In the simplest creatures it is sometimes difficult to see it as DNA death, since the strands ofreplicating they leave be-The Long Habit 49 hind are more conspicuously the living parts ofthemselves than with us (not that it is fundamentally any different, but it seems so). Flies do not develop a ward round ofdiseases that carry them off, one by one. They simply age, and die, like flies. We hanker to go on, even in the face ofplain evidence that long, long lives are not necessarily pleasurable in the kind ofsociety we have arranged thus far. We will be lucky if we can postpone the search for new technologies for a while, until we have discovered some satisfactory things to do with the extra time. Something will surely have to be found to take theplaceofsittingon theporch re-examining one's watch. Perhaps we would not be so anxious to prolong life ifwe did not detest so much the sickness of withdrawal. It is astonishing how little information we have about this uni- versal process, with all the other dazzling advances in bi- ology. It is almost as though we wanted not to know about it. Even if we could imagine the act of death in isolation, without any preliminary stage ofbeing struck down by dis- ease, we would be fearful of it. There are signs that medicine may be taking a new inter- est in the process, partly from curiosity, partly from an embarrassed realization thatwehave notbeen handling this aspect ofdisease with as much skill as physicians once dis- played, back in the days before they became convinced that disease was their solitary and sometimes defeatable enemy. It used to be the hardest and most important of all the services ofagood doctor to beon hand at the timeofdeath and toprovidecomfort, usually in the home. Nowitisdone in hospitals, in secrecy (one ofthe reasons for the increased fear of death these days may be that so many people are totally unfamiliar with it; they never actually see it happen in real life). Some ofour technology permits us to deny its existence, and we maintain flickers oflife for long stretches50 The Lives ofa Cell in one community of cells or another, as though we were keepingaflagflying. Death isnotasudden-all-at-onceaffair; cellsgodown in sequence, one byone. Youcan, ifyou like, recover great numbers ofthem many hours after the lights have gone out, and grow them out in cultures. It takes hours, even days, before the irreversible word finally gets around to all the provinces. We may be about to rediscover that dying is not such a bad thing to do after all. Sir William Osier took this view: he disapproved ofpeople who spoke ofthe agony ofdeath, maintaining that there was no such thing. In a nineteenth-century memoir on an expedition in Africa, there is a story by David Livingston about his own experience ofnear-death. He was caught by a lion, crushed across the chest in the animal's great jaws, and saved in the instant by alucky shotfrom afriend. Later, he remembered theepisodeincleardetail. Hewassoamazed bytheextraor- dinarysenseofpeace,calm, and totalpainlessnessassociated with being killed that he constructed a theory that all crea- tures are provided with a protective physiologic mech- anism, switched on at the verge of death, carrying them through in a haze of tranquillity. I have seen agony in death only once, in a patient with rabies; he remained acutely aware of every stage in the process of his own disintegration over a twenty-four-hour period, rightuptohis final moment. Itwasasthough, in the special neuropathology of rabies, the switch had been pre- vented from turning. Wewill behavingnewopportunities to learn moreabout the physiology of death at first hand, from the increasing numbers of cardiac patients who have been through the whole process and then back again.Judging from what has been found out thus far, from the firstgeneration ofpeople resuscitated from cardiac standstill (already termed the Lazarus syndrome), Osier seems to have been right. ThoseThe Long Habit 51 who remember parts or all of their episodes do not recall any fear, or anguish. Several people who remained con- scious throughout, while appearing to have been quite dead, could onlydescribearemarkable sensationofdetach- ment. One man underwent coronary occlusion with cessa- tion of the heart and dropped for all practical purposes dead, in front ofa hospital; within a few minutes his heart had been restarted by electrodes and he breathed his way back into life. According to his account, the strangest thing was that there were so manypeoplearound him, movingso urgently, handling his body with such excitement, while all his awareness was of quietude. In a recent study ofthe reaction to dying in patients with obstructive disease of the lungs, it was concluded that the process was considerably more shattering for the profes- sional observers than the observed. Most of the patients appeared to be preparing themselves with equanimity for death, as though intuitively familiar with the business. One elderly woman reported that the only painful and distress- ing part ofthe process was in being interrupted; on several occasions she was provided with conventional therapeutic measurestomaintainoxygenationorrestorefluidsand elec- trolytes, and each time she found the experience ofcoming back harrowing; she deeply resented the interference with her dying. I find myself surprised by the thought that dying is an all-right thing to do, but perhaps it should not surprise. It is, after all, the most ancient and fundamental of biologic functions, with its mechanisms worked out with the same attention to detail, the same provision for the advantage of the organism, the same abundance of genetic information for guidance through the stages, that we have long since become accustomed to finding in all the crucial acts of liv- ing. Very well. But even so, if the transformation is a coor-52 The Lives ofa Cell dinated, integrated physiologic process in its initial, local stages, there is still that permanent vanishing ofconscious- ness to be accounted for. Are we to be stuck forever with this problem? Where on earth does it go? Is it simply stopped dead in its tracks, lost in humus, wasted? Consider- ing the tendency of nature to find uses for complex and intricate mechanisms, this seems to me unnatural. I prefer to think of it as somehow separated off at the filaments of itsattachment, and then drawn likeaneasy breath backinto the membraneofitsorigin, afresh memory forabiospheri- cal nervous system, but I have no data on the matter. This is for another science, another day. It may turn out, as some scientists suggest, that we are forever precluded from investigatingconsciousness by asortofindeterminacy principle that stipulates that the very act of looking will make it twitch and blur out ofsight. It this is true, we will never learn. I envy some ofmy friends who are convinced about telepathy; oddly enough, it is my European scientist acquaintances who believe it most freely and take it most lightly. All their aunts have received Communications, and there they sit, with proofofthe motility ofconsciousness at their fingertips, and the making ofa new science.

When social animals aregathered together in groups, they become qualitatively different creatures from what they were when alone or in pairs. Single locusts are quiet, meditative, sessile things, but when locusts are added to other locusts, they become excited, change color, undergo spectacular endocrine revisions, and intensify their activity until, when there are enough of them packed shoulder to shoulder, they vibrate and hum with the energy of a jet airliner and take off. Watson, Nel, and Hewitt have collected large numbers oftermites in the field and placed them together for obser- vation, in groups and pairs. The grouped termites become increasingly friendly and active, but show no inclination to lay eggs or mate; instead, they cut down on their water intake, watchingtheirweight,and themitochondriaoftheir flight muscles escalate in metabolic activity. Grouped ter- mites keep touchingeachotherincessantly with theiranten- nae, and this appears to be the central governing mech- anism. It is the being touched that counts, rather than the act of touching. Deprived of antennae, any termite can become a group termite if touched frequently enough by the others. Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from thegroup, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, 5354 The Lives ofa Cell standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touchingeachother. Sometimes, theyeven biteoffthe distal halvesofeachother'santennae, toeliminatethetemp- tation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the layingofeggs and the taking care ofthe brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. Themost intenselysocial animalscan onlyadapttogroup behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, ex- cept to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more lifeofhisown than acast-offcell marooned from the surface of your skin. Ants are more like the parts ofan animal than entities on their own. They are mobile cells, circulating through a dense connective tissue of other ants in a matrix of twigs. The circuits are so intimately woven that the anthill meets all the essential criteria of an organism. It would be wonderful to understand how the anthill communication system works. Somehow, by touching each other continually, by exchanging bits ofwhite stuffcarried aboutin theirmandibles likemoney, they managetoinform the whole enterprise about the state of the world outside, the location of food, the nearness of enemies, the mainte- nance requirements of the Hill, even the direction of the sun; in the Alps, mountaineers are said to use the ameboid configurations of elongated ant nests as pointers to the south. The Hill, for its part, responds by administering the affairs of the institution, coordinating and synchroniz- ing the movements ofits crawlingparts, aerating and clean- ing the nest so that it can last for as long as forty years, fetching food in by long tentacles, rearing broods, taking slaves, raising crops, and, at one time or another, budding off subcolonies in the near vicinity, as progeny.

And now, at last, they have become an Art Form. A gallery in NewYorkexhibited acollection of2 million live army ants, on loan from Central America, in a one-colony show entitled \"Patterns and Structures.\" They were dis- played on sand in a huge square bin, walled by plastic sides high enough to prevent them from crawling over and out into Manhattan. The inventor of the work, Alan Sonfist, arranged and rearranged the location of food sources in differentplaces, according to his inspiration and their taste, and they formed themselves into long, black, ropypatterns, extended likewrithinglimbs, hands, fingers, acrossthesand in crescents, crisscrosses, and longellipses, from onestation to another. Thus deployed, they were watched with inten- sity by thecrowdsofwinter-carapaced peoplewho lined up in neat rows togaze down atthem. The ants were, together with the New Yorkers, an abstraction, a live mobile, an actionpainting, apieceoffound art, ahappening, aparody, depending on the light. I can imagine the people moving around theedges ofthe plastic barrier, touching shoulder to shoulder, sometimes touching hands, exchanging bits of information, nodding, smiling sometimes, prepared as New Yorkers always are to take flight at a moment's notice, their mitochondria fully stokedand steaming.Theymoveinorderlylinesaround the box, crowding one another precisely, without injury, peer- ing down, nodding, and then backing offto let new people in. Seen fromadistance, clustered denselyaround thewhite plasticboxcontainingthelongserpentinelinesofarmyants, turning to each other and murmuring repetitively, they seem an absolute marvel. They might have dropped here from another planet.— 56 The Lives ofa Cell I am sad that I did not see any ofthis myself. By the time I had received the communication on television and in my morningpaper, feltthetuggingpulltoward Manhattan, and made my preparations to migrate, I learned that the army ants had all died. The Art Form simply disintegrated, all at once, like one ofthose exploding, vanishing faces in paintings by the Brit- ish artist Francis Bacon. There was no explanation, beyond the rumored, un- proved possibility of cold drafts in the gallery over the weekend. Monday morning they were sluggish, moving with less precision, dully. Then, the death began, affecting firstonepartand thenanother,and withinadayall 2 million were dead, swept away into large plastic bags and put out- side for engulfment and digestion by the sanitation truck. It is a melancholy parable. I am unsure of the meaning, but I do think it has something to do with all that plastic that, and the distance from the earth. It is a long, long way from the earth ofa Central American jungle to the ground floorofagallery,especiallywhenyouconsiderthatManhat- tan itself is suspended on a kind of concrete platform, propped upbyameshworkofwires,pipes,and watermains. But I think it was chiefly the plastic, which seems to me the mostunearthlyofall man'screations sofar. I do not believe you can suspend army ants away from the earth, on plastic, for any length of time. They will lose touch, run out of energy, and die for lack of current. One steps on ants, single ants or small clusters, every day without giving it a thought, but it is impossible to contem- plate the death of so vast a beast as these 2 million ants without feeling twinges of sympathy, and something else. Nervously, thinking this way, thinking especially about Manhattanand theplasticplatform, I laid down my newspa- per and reached for the book on my shelfthat contained, I knew, precisely the paragraph of reassurance required by the moment:Antaeus in Manhattan 57 It is notsurprising that manyanalogies have been drawn between the social insects and human societies. Fundamentally, however, these are misleadingor meaningless, for the behaviorofinsects is rigidly stereotyped and determined by innate instructive mech- anisms; they show little or no insightorcapacity for learning, and they lack the ability to develop a social tradition based on the accumulated experience of many generations. It is, of course, an incomplete comfort to read this sort ofthing to one's self. For full effect, it needs reading aloud by several people at once, moving the lips in synchrony.ThelHBL nee you have becomepermanently startled, as I am, by the realization that we are a social species, you tend to keep an eye out for pieces ofevidence that this is, by and large, a good thing for us.

Itactually started earlier, in 1871, when Woods Hole, Massachusetts, was selected for a Bureau ofFisheries Station and the news got round that all sortsofmarineand estuarinelifecould befound here in the collisions between the Gulf Stream and northern currents offshore, plus birds to watch. Academic types drifted down from Boston, looked around, began explaining things to each other, and the place was off and running. The MBL has grown slowly but steadily from the outset, sprouting new buildings from time to time, taking on new functions, expanding, drawing to itselfby a sort oftropism greater numbers of biological scientists each summer, at- tractingstudentsfromallpartsoftheworld. Today, itstands as the uniquely national center for biology in this country; it is the National Biological Laboratory without being offi- cially designated (or yet funded) as such. Its influence on the growth and development of biologic science has been equivalenttothatofmanyofthecountry'suniversitiescom- bined, for it has had its pick ofthe world's scientific talent foreachsummer's researchand teaching.

Someone has counted thirty Nobel Laureates who have worked at the MBL at one time or another.60 The Lives ofa Cell It is amazing that such an institution, exerting so much influence on academic science, has been able to remain so absolutely autonomous. It has, to be sure, linkages ofvari- ouskinds,arrangementswithoutsideuniversitiesforcertain graduateprograms, and itadheresdelicately, somewhatam- biguously, to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute just up the street. But it has never come under the domination ofany outside institution or governmental agency, nor has it ever been told what to do by any outside group. Inter- nally, the important institutional decisions seem to have been made by a process ofaccommodation and adaptation, with resistible forces always meeting movable objects.

In recent years there have been expansion and strengthening in new fields; biologic membranes, im- munology, genetics, and cell regulatory mechanisms are currently booming. You can never tell when new things may be starting up from improbable lines ofwork. The amebocytes ofstarfish were recently found to contain a material that immobilizes the macrophages ofmammals, resembling a product ofim- mune lymphocytes in higher forms. Aplysia, a sea slug that looks as though it couldn't be good for anything, has been found byneurophysiologiststobefilled withtruth. Limulus, one ofthe world's conservative beasts, has recently been inTbeMBL 61 the newspapers; it was discovered to contain a reagent for the detection of vanishingly small quantities of endotoxin fromgram-negative bacteria, arid the pharmaceutical indus- tryhasalreadysniffed commercialpossibilitiesforthe moni- toring ofpyrogen-free materials; horseshoe crabs may soon be as marketable as lobsters. There is noway ofpredicting what the future will be like for an institution such as the MBL. One way or another, it will evolve. It may shift soon into a new phase, with a year-round program for teaching and research and a year- round staff, but it will have toaccomplish this without jeop- ardizing the immense powerofits summerprograms, orall institutional hell will break loose. It will have to find new waysforrelatingtotheuniversities, ifitsgraduateprograms are to expand as they should. It will have to develop new symbiotic relations with the Oceanographic Institute, since both places have so much at stake. And it will have to find — more money, much more the kind of money that only — federalgovernmentspossess withoutlosinganyofitsown initiative. Itwill bean interestingplacetowatch, in theyearsahead. In a rational world, things ought to go as well for the MBL as theyhaveinthepast,and itshould becomeaneven larger and more agile collective intelligence. If you can think of good questions to ask about the life ofthe earth, it should be as good a place as any to go for answers. It is now, in fact. You might begin at the local beach, which functions as a sort of ganglion. It is called Stony Beach, because it used to be covered, painfully, by small stones. Long ago, somehow, some committee of scientists, prodded by footsore wives, found enough money to cover itwithalayerofsand. Itisthemostminorofbeaches, hardly big enough for a committee, but close enough to the laboratories so that the investigators can walk down for a sandwich lunch with their children on sunny weekdays.62 The Lives ofa Cell From time to time, pure physicists turn up, with only a few minutes to spare from a meeting at the National Academy summer headquarters, tired from making forecasts on clas- sifiedly obscure matters, wearing the look of doom. The physicistsareanotherspecies,whiter-skinned, towel-draped againstthesun, unearthly, thesolesoftheirfeetsosensitive that they limp on sand. A small boy, five-ish, with myopia and glasses, emerges from the water; characteristically, although his hair is drip- pinghisglassesarebonedry;hehasalreadybeguntomaster technique. As he picks his way between the conversations, heading for his mother, who is explaining homology be- DNA tween in chloroplasts and bacteria, he is shaking his head slowly in wonderment, looking at something brown and gelatinous held in his hand, saying, \"That is very inter- esting water.\" At Stony Beach the water is regarded as primarily interesting, even by small boys. On weekends, in hot midsummer, you can see how the governingmechanismswork. Itissocrowded thatonemust pickone's way on tiptoe to find a hunchingplace, but there is always a lot of standing up anyway; biologists seem to prefer standing on beaches, talkingateach other, gesturing to indicate the way things are assembled, bending down to draw diagrams in the sand. By the end ofthe day, the sand is crisscrossed with a mesh ofordinates, abscissas, curves to account for everything in nature. You can hear the sound from the beach at a distance, before you see the people. It is that most extraordinary noise, half-shout, half-song, made by confluent, simultane- ously raised human voices, explaining things to each other. You hear a similarsound at the close of the Friday Eve- ning Lecture, the MBL's weekly grand occasion, when the guest lecturers from around the world turn up to present theirmoststunningpiecesofscience. As the audience flows outoftheauditorium, thereisthesamejubilantdescant, theTheMBL 63 great sound of crowded people explaining things to each otheras fastas their minds will work. You cannot make out individual words—in the mass, except that the recurrent phrase, \"But look \" keeps bobbing above the surfoflan- guage. Not many institutions can produce this spontaneous mu- sic at will, summer after summer, year after year. It takes a special gift, and the MBL appears to have been born with it. Perhaps this is an aspect of the way we build language afterall. The scale isvery small, and it is notatallclearhow it works, but it makes a nice thought for a time when we can't seem to get anything straight or do anything right.Autonomy Working atypewriterbytouch,likeridingabicycle or strolling on apath, is best done by notgiving it aglancing thought. Once you do, your fingers fumble and hit the wrong keys. To do things involving practiced skills, you need to turn loose the systems ofmus- cles and nerves responsible for each maneuver, place them on their own, and stay out of it. There is no real loss of authority in this, since you get to decide whether to do the thing or not, and you can intervene and embellish the tech- nique any time you like; ifyou want to ride a bicycle back- ward, or walk with an eccentric loping gait giving a little skip every fourth step, whistling at the same time, you can dothat. Butifyouconcentrateyourattentionon thedetails, keeping in touch with each muscle, thrusting yourselfinto a free fall with each step and catching yourself at the last moment by sticking out the other foot in time to break the fall, you will end up immobilized, vibrating with fatigue. It is a blessing to have options for choice and change in the learning of such unconsciously coordinated acts. If we werebornwithalltheseknacks inbuilt, automated likeants, wewould surely miss thevariety. Itwould bealess interest- ing world ifwe all walked and skipped alike, and neverfell from bicycles. If we were all genetically programmed to play the piano deftly from birth, we might never learn to understand music. The rules are different for the complicated, coordinated, fantastically skilled manipulations we perform with our in- sides. We do not have to learn anything. Our smooth- 64Autonomy 65 muscle cells are born with complete instructions, in need of no help from us, and they work away on their own schedules, modulating the lumen ofblood vessels, moving things through intestines, opening and closing tubules ac- cording to the requirements ofthe entire system. Secretory cells elaborate their products in privacy; the heartcontracts and relaxes; hormones are sent offto react silently with cell membranes, switching adenyl cyclase, prostaglandin, and other signals on and off; cells communicate with each other by simply touching; organelles send messages to other or- ganelles; all this goes on continually, without ever a per- sonal word from us. The arrangement is that ofan ecosys- tem, with theoperation ofeach part beinggoverned by the state and function of all the other parts. When things are going well, as they generally are, it is an infallible mech- anism. But now the autonomy of this interior domain, long re- garded as inviolate, is open to question. The experimental psychologists have recently found that visceral organs can be taught to do various things, as easily as a boy learns to ride a bicycle, by the instrumental techniques of operant conditioning. Ifathingisdonein thewaytheteacherwants, at a signal, and a suitable reward given immediately to reinforce the action, it becomes learned. Rats, rewarded by stimulation oftheir cerebral \"pleasure centers,\" have been instructed to speed up or slowdown their hearts atasignal, or to alter their blood pressures, or switch offcertain waves in their electroencephalograms and switch on others. The same technology has been applied to human beings, with other kinds of rewards, and the results have been startling. It is claimed that you can teach your kidneys to change the rate of urine formation, raise or lower your bloodpressure,changeyourheartrate, writedifferentbrain waves, at will. There is already talk ofa breakthrough in the prevention66 The Lives ofa Cell and treatment ofhuman disease. According to proponents, whenthetechnologyisperfectedandextended itwillsurely lead to new possibilities for therapy. Ifa rat can be trained todilate the bloodvesselsofoneofhisears morethan those ofthe other, as has been reported, what rich experiences in self-control and self-operation may lie just ahead for man? There are already cryptic advertisements in the Personal columns ofliterary magazines, urging the purchase ofelec- tronic headsets for the training and regulation ofone's own brain waves, according to one's taste. You can have it. Not to downgrade it. It is extremely important, I know, and one ought to feel elated by the prospect oftaking per- sonal charge, calling the shots, running one's cells around liketoytrains. Nowthatweknowthatvisceracanbetaught, the thought comes naturally that we've been neglecting them all these years, and by judicious application ofhuman intelligence, these primitive structures can be trained to whatever standards of behavior we wish to set for them. My trouble, to be quite candid, is a lack ofconfidence in myself. If I were informed tomorrow that I was in direct communication with my liver, and could now take over, I would become deeply depressed. I'd sooner be told, forty thousand feet over Denver, that the 747 jet in which I had a coach seat was now mine to operate as I pleased; at least I would have the hope of bailing out, if I could find a parachute and discover quickly how to open a door. Noth- ing would save me and my liver, ifI were in charge. For I am, to face the facts squarely, considerably less intelligent than my liver. I am, moreover, constitutionally unable to make hepatic decisions, and I prefer not to be obliged to, ever. I would not be able to think of the first thing to do. I have the same feeling about the rest of my working parts. They are all better off without my intervention, in whatever they do. It might be somethingofatemptation toAutonomy 67 take over my brain, on paper, but I cannot imagine doing so in real life. I would lose track, get things mixed up, turn on wrong cells at wrong times, drop things. I doubt if I would ever be able to think up my own thoughts. My cells were born, or differentiated anyway, knowing how to do this kind ofthing together. IfI moved in to organize them they would resent it, perhaps become frightened, perhaps swarm out into my ventricles like bees. Although it is, as I say, a temptation. I have never really been satisfied with the operation ofmy brain, and it might be fun to try running it myself, just once. There are several things I would change, given the opportunity: certain memoriesthattend toslipawayunrecorded,othersI'vehad enough of and would prefer to delete, certain notions I'd just as soon didn't keep popping in, trains of thought that go round and round without getting anywhere, rather like thisone. I'vealwayssuspected thatsomeofthecells inthere are fluffing offmuch ofthe time, and I'd like to see a little more attention and real work. Also, while I'm about it, I could do with a bit more respect. On balance, however, I think it best to stay out of this business. Once you began, there would be no end to the responsibilities. I'd rather leave all my automatic functions with as much autonomy as they please, and hope for the best. Imagine having to worry about running leukocytes, keeping track, herding them here and there, listening for signals. After the first flush ofpride in ownership, it would be exhausting and debilitating, and there would be no time for anything else. What to do, then? It cannot simply be left there. If we have learned anything atall in thiscentury, it is thatall new technologies will be put to use, sooner or later, for better or worse, as it is in our nature to do. We cannot expect an exception for the instrumental conditioning of autonomic functions. We will be driven to make use of it, trying to68 The Lives ofa Cell communicate with our internal environment, to meddle, and itwill consume so much ofourenergy thatwe will end up even more cut offfrom things outside, missing the main sources of the sensation of living. I have a suggestion for a way out. Given the capacity to control autonomic functions, modulate brain waves, run cells, why shouldn't it be possible to employ exactly the same technology to go in precisely the opposite direction? Instead ofgetting in there and taking things over, couldn't we learn to disconnect altogether, uncouple, detach, and float free? You would only need to be careful, ifyou tried it, that you let go of the right end. Ofcourse,peoplehavebeentryingtodothissortofthing for a long time, by other techniques and with varying de- grees ofluck. This is what Zen archery seems to be about, come to think of it. You learn, after long months ofstudy under a master, to release the arrow without releasing it yourself. Your fingers must do the releasing, on theirown, remotely, like the opening of a flower. When you have learned this, no matter where the arrow goes, you have it made. You can step outside for a look around.Organdies as Organisms We seem to be living through the biologic revolu- tion, so far anyway, without being upheaved or even much disturbed by it. Even without being entirelyclearaboutjustwhatitis, wearealllearningtotake it forgranted. It is acurious, peaceful sort ofrevolution, in which there is no general apprehension that old views are being outraged and overturned. Instead, whole, great new blocks ofinformation are being brought in almostdailyand put precisely down in what were previously empty spaces. DNA Thenewsabout and thegeneticcodedid notdisplace an earlier dogma; there was nothing much there to be moved aside.

Allsortsofrevolutionarychanges in technology are postulated for the future, ranging from final control of human disease to solutions of the world food and popula- tionproblems. Weareevenbeginningtoargueaboutwhich futures we like and which we prefer to cancel. Questions about the merits of genetic engineering, the cloning of desirable human beings from single cells, and even, I sup- pose, the possibility that two heads might actually be better than one, are already being debated at seminars. 6970 The Lives ofa Cell So far, we don't seem to have been really shocked by anything among the items ofnew knowledge. There is sur- prise, even astonishment, but not yet dismay. Perhaps it is still too early to expect this, and it may lie just ahead. Itis nottooearlytobegin lookingfortrouble. I cansense some, for myself anyway, in what is being learned about organelles. I was raised in thebeliefthatthese wereobscure little engines inside my cells, owned and operated by meor my cellular delegates, private, submicroscopic bits of my intelligent flesh. Now, it appears, some of them, and the most important ones at that, are total strangers. Theevidenceisstrong,anddirect.Themembraneslining the inner compartment of mitochondria are unlike other animal cell membranes, and resemble most closely the DNA membranes of bacteria. The of mitochondria is DNA qualitatively different from the ofanimal cell nuclei and strikingly similar to bacterial DNA; moreover, like microbial DNA, it is closely associated with membranes. The RNA of mitochondria matches the organelles' DNA, but not that ofthe nucleus. The ribosomes inside the mito- chondria are similar to bacterial ribosomes, and different from animal ribosomes. The mitochondria do not arise de novo incells; theyarealwaysthere, replicatingontheirown, independently of the replication of the cell. They travel down from egg to newborn; a few come in with the sperm, but most are maternal passengers. The chloroplasts in all plants are, similarly, independent and self-replicatinglodgers, with theirownDNAand RNA and ribosomes. In structure and pigment content they are the images ofprokaryotic blue-green algae. It has recently been reported thatthe nucleicacid ofchloroplasts is, in fact, homologous with that of certain photosynthetic micro- organisms. There may be more. It has been suggested that flagellae andciliawereoncespirochetesthatjoinedupwith theotherOrganelles as Organisms 71 prokaryotes when nucleated cells were being pieced to- gether.Thecentriolesand basalbodiesarebelieved insome quarters to be semiautonomous organisms with their own separate genomes. Perhaps there are others, still unrecog- nized. I only hope I can retain title to my nuclei. It is surprising that we take information like this so calmly, as though it fitted in nicely with notions we've had all along. Actually, the suggestion that chloroplasts and mitochondria might be endosymbionts was made as long ago as 1885, but one might expect, nevertheless, that con- firmation of the suggestion would have sent the investiga- torsoutintothestreets, hallooing. Butthis isasober, indus- triousfield, and theworkgoeson methodically, with special interest just now in the molecular genetics of organelles. There is careful, restrained speculation on how they got there in the first place, with a consensus that they were probably engulfed by larger cells more than a billion years ago and have simply stayed there ever since. Theusual wayoflookingatthem isasenslaved creatures, captured to supply ATP for cells unable to respire on their own, or to provide carbohydrate and oxygen for cells une- quipped for photosynthesis. This master-slave arrangement is thecommon viewoffull-grown biologists, eukaryotes all. But there is the other side. From their own standpoint, the organelles might be viewed as having learned early how to have the best of possible worlds, with least effort and risk to themselves and their progeny. Instead ofevolving as we have done, manufacturing longer and elaborately longer DN strandsof A, and runningever-increasingrisksofmutat- ing into evolutionary cul-de-sacs, they elected to stay small and stick to one line of work. To accomplish this, and to assure themselves the longest possible run, they got them- selves inside all the rest of us. It is a good thing for the entire enterprise that mito-72 The Lives ofa Cell chondria and chloroplasts have remained small, conserva- tive, and stable, since these two organelles are, in a funda- mental sense, the most important living things on earth. Between them they produce the oxygen and arrange for its use. In effect, they run the place. Mymitochondriacompriseaverylargeproportionofme. I cannot do the calculation, but I suppose there is almost as much of them in sheer dry bulk as there is the rest of me. Looked at in this way, I could be taken for a very large, motile colony of respiring bacteria, operating a complex systemofnuclei, microtubules,and neuronsforthepleasure and sustenance of their families, and running, at the mo- ment, a typewriter. I am intimately involved, and obliged to do a great deal ofessential work for my mitochondria. My nuclei code out the outer membranes of each, and a good many of the enzymes attached to the cristae must be synthesized by me. Eachofthem, byallaccounts, makesonlyenoughofitsown materials toget along on, and the rest must come from me. And I am the one who has to do the worrying. Now that I know about the situation, I can find all kinds of things to worry about. Viruses, for example. If my or- ganellesare reallysymbiotic bacteria, colonizingme, what's to prevent them from catching a virus, or ifthey have such a thing as lysogeny, from conveying a phage to other or- ganelles? Then there is the question of my estate. Do my mitochondria all die with me, or did my children get some ofmine along with their mother's; this sort ofthing should not worry me, I know, but it does. Finally, there is the whole question ofmy identity, and, more than that, my human dignity. I did not mind it when I first learned ofmy descent from lower forms oflife. I had in mind an arboreal family of beetle-browed, speechless, hairy sub-men, ape-like, and I've never objected to them as forebears. Indeed, being Welsh, I feel the better for it,Organelles as Organisms 73 having clearly risen above them in my time ofevolution. It is a source ofsatisfaction to be part ofthe improvement of the species. But not these things. I had never bargained on descent from single cells without nuclei. I could even make my peace with that, if it were all, but there is the additional humiliation thatI have not, inareal sense, descended atall. I havebroughtthemallalongwithme,orperhapstheyhave brought me. It is no good standing on dignity in a situation like this, and better not to try. It is a mystery. There they are, moving about in my cytoplasm, breathing for my own flesh, but strangers. They are much less closely related to me than to each other and to the free-living bacteria out under the hill. They feel like strangers, but the thought comes that the same creatures, precisely the same, are out there in the cells of sea gulls, and whales, and dune grass, and seaweed, and hermit crabs, and fur- ther inland in the leaves of the beech in my backyard, and in the family of skunks beneath the back fence, and even in that fly on the window. Through them, I am connected; I have close relatives, once removed, all over the place. This is a new kind of information, for me, and I regret somewhat that I cannot be in closer touch with my mitochondria. If I concentrate, I can imagine that I feel them; they do not quite squirm, but there is, from time to time, a kind of tingle. I cannot help thinking that if only I knew more about them, and how they maintain our synchrony, I would have a new way to explain music to myself. There is something intrinsically good-natured about all symbioticrelations, necessarily, butthisone,which isproba- bly the most ancient and most firmly established of all, seems especially equable. There is nothing resembling pre- dation, and no pretense of an adversary stance on either74 The Lives ofa Cell side. Ifyou were looking for something like natural law to take the place ofthe \"social Darwinism\" ofa century ago, you would haveahard timedrawinglessons from thesense of life alluded to by chloroplasts and mitochondria, but there it is.Germs mm / atchingtelevision, you'd thinkwe lived at bay, in ^mfmf total jeopardy, surrounded on all sides by hu- man-seeking germs, shielded against infection and death only by a chemical technology that enables us to keep killing them off.

We live in a world where the microbes are always trying to getatus, to tearuscell from cell, and weonlystayaliveand whole through diligence and fear. We still think of human disease as the work ofan orga- nized, modernized kind ofdemonology, in which the bac- teria are the most visible and centrally placed ofouradver- saries. We assume that they mustsomehow relish what they do. They come after us for profit, and there are so many of them that disease seems inevitable, a natural part of the human condition; ifwe succeed in eliminating one kind of disease there will always be a new one at hand, waiting to take its place. These are paranoid delusions on a societal scale, explain- 7576 The Lives ofa Cell able in part by our need for enemies, and in part by our memory ofwhat things used to be like. Until afew decades ago, bacteria were a genuine household threat, and al- though most ofus survived them, we were always aware of the nearness ofdeath. We moved, with our families, in and We out of death. had lobar pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis, streptococcal infections, diphtheria, endocardi- tis, entericfevers, various septicemias, syphilis, and, always, everywhere, tuberculosis. Mostofthese have now left most of us, thanks to antibiotics, plumbing, civilization, and money, but we remember. In real life, however, even in ourworstcircumstances we have always been a relatively minor interest of the vast microbial world. Pathogenicity is not the rule. Indeed, it occurs so infrequently and involves such a relatively small number ofspecies, considering the huge population ofbac- teria on the earth, that it has a freakish aspect. Disease usually resultsfrom inconclusivenegotiationsforsymbiosis, an overstepping of the line by one side or the other, a biologic misinterpretation of borders. Some bacteria are only harmful to us when they make exotoxins, and they only do this when they are, in a sense, diseased themselves. The toxins of diphtheria bacilli and streptococci are produced when the organisms have been infected by bacteriophage; it is the virus that provides the code for toxin. Uninfected bacteria are uninformed. When wecatch diphtheria itis avirus infection, but notofus. Our involvement is not thatofan adversary in astraightforward game, but more like blundering into someone else's acci- dent. Ican thinkofafew microorganisms,possiblythetubercle bacillus, the syphilis spirochete, the malarial parasite, and a few others, that have a selective advantage in their ability to infect human beings, but there is nothing to be gained, in an evolutionary sense, by the capacity to cause illness orGerms 77 death. Pathogenicity may be something of a disadvantage for most microbes, carrying lethal risks more frightening to them than to us. The man who catches a meningococcus is in considerably less danger for his life, even without chemotherapy, than meningococci with the bad luck to catch a man. Most meningococci have the sense to stay out on the surface, in the rhinopharynx. During epidemics this is where they are to be found in the majority of the host population, and it generally goes well. It is only in the unaccountableminority, the\"cases,\" thatthelineiscrossed, and then there is the devil to pay on both sides, but most of all for the meningococci. Staphylococci live all over us, and seem to have adapted toconditions in our skin thatare uncongenial to mostother bacteria. When you count them up, and us, it is remarkable how little trouble we have with the relation. Only a few of us are plagued by boils, and we can blame a large part of the destruction oftissues on the zeal ofourown leukocytes. Hemolytic streptococci are among our closest intimates, even to the extent ofsharing antigens with the membranes of our muscle cells; it is our reaction to their presence, in the form of rheumatic fever, that gets us into trouble. We can carry brucella for long periods in the cells of our reticuloendothelial system without any awareness of their existence; then cyclically, for reasons not understood but probably related to immunologic reactions on our part, we sense them, and the reaction of sensing is the clinical dis- ease. Most bacteria are totally preoccupied with browsing, al- tering the configurations oforganic molecules so that they become usable for the energy needs ofother forms oflife. They are, by and large, indispensable to each other, living in interdependentcommunitiesin thesoilorsea. Somehave become symbionts in more specialized, local relations, liv- ing as working parts in the tissues ofhigherorganisms. The78 The Lives ofa Cell root nodules oflegumes would have neitherform norfunc- tion without the masses ofrhizobial bacteria swarming into roothairs, incorporating themselves with such intimacy that only an electron microscope can detect which membranes are bacterial and which plant. Insects have colonies ofbac- teria, the mycetocytes, living in them like little glands, do- ing heaven knows what but beingessential. The microfloras ofanimal intestinal tracts are part ofthe nutritional system. And then, ofcourse, thereare the mitochondriaand chloro- plasts, permanent residents in everything. The mic—roorganisms that seem to have it in for us—in the worst way the ones that really appear to wish us ill turn outon close examination to be rather more like bystanders, strays, strangers in from the cold. They will invade and replicate ifgiven thechance, and some ofthem willgetinto our deepest tissues and set forth in the blood, but it is our response to theirpresence thatmakes the disease. Ourarse- nals for fightingoffbacteriaare sopowerful, and involve so many different defense mechanisms, that we are in more danger from them than from the invaders. We live in the midst of explosive devices; we are mined. Itistheinformationcarried bythebacteriathatwecannot abide. Thegram-negative bacteriaare the best examples ofthis. They display lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in their walls, and thesemacromoleculesareread byourtissuesasthevery worst of bad news. When we sense lipopolysaccharide, we are likely to turn on every defense at our disposal; we will bomb, defoliate, blockade, seal off, and destroy all the tis- sues in the area.

There is nothing intrinsicallypoisonousaboutendotoxin, butitmust lookawful,orfeelawful,whensensed bycells. Cellsbelieve that it signifies the presence ofgram-negative bacteria, and they will stop at nothing to avoid this threat. I used to think that only the most highly developed, civilized animalscould befooled in thisway, butitis notso. The horseshoe crab is a primitive fossil ofa beast, ancient and uncitified, buthe isjustasvulnerabletodisorganization by endotoxin as a rabbit or a man. Bang has shown that an injection ofavery smalldose intothe bodycavitywillcause the aggregation of hemocytes in ponderous, immovable masses that block the vascular channels, and a gelatinous clot brings the circulation to a standstill. It is now known that a limulus clotting system, perhaps ancestral to ours, is centrallyinvolved in the reaction. Extractsofthe hemocytes can be made to jell by adding extremely small amounts of endotoxin. The self-disintegration ofthe whole animal that follows a systemic injection can be interpreted as a well- intentioned but lethal error. The mechanism is itselfquite agood one, when used withprecisionand restraint,admira- bly designed for coping with intrusion by a single bac- terium: thehemocytewould beattracted tothesite,extrude the coagulable protein, the microorganism would be en- trapped and immobilized, and the thing would be finished. It is when confronted by the overwhelming signal of free molecules of endotoxin, evoking memories of vibrios in great numbers, that the limulus flies into panic, launches all his defenses at once, and destroys himself. It is, basically, a response to propaganda, something like the panic-producing pheromones that slave-taking ants re-80 The Lives ofa Cell lease to disorganize the colonies of their prey. I thinkitlikelythatmanyofourdiseasesworkinthisway. Sometimes, the mechanisms used for overkill are im- munologic, but often, as in the limulus model, they are more primitive kinds of memory.

Soonerorlater,wearebound togetintotroublewith this word. It is too solid and unequivocal a term to be used as a euphemism and this seems to be what we are attempting. I am worried that we may be overdoing it, taxing its mean- ing, to conceal an unmentionable reality that we've some- how agreed not to talk about in public. It won't work. Illness and death still exist and cannot be hidden. We are still beset by plain diseases, and we do not control them; they are loose on their own, afflicting us unpredictably and haphazardly. Weareonly able todeal with them when they have made their appearance, and we must use the methods ofmedical care for this, as best we can, for betteror worse. It would be a better world if this were not true, but the fact is that diseases do not develop just because ofcareless- ness about the preservation of health. We do not become sick only because of a failure of vigilance. Most illnesses, especially the major ones, are blind accidents that we have no idea how to prevent. We are really not all that good at — preventing disease orpreserving health not yet anyway and wearenotlikelytobeuntilwehavelearnedagreatdeal about disease mechanisms. There is disagreement on this point, ofcourse. Some of the believers among us are convinced that once we get a health-care delivery system that really works, the country might becomeasortofgigantic spa, offering, like the labels on European mineral-water bottles, preventives for every-Your Very Good Health 83 thing from weak kidneys to moroseness. It is a surprise that we haven't already learned that the word is a fallible incantation. Several decades of mental health have not made schizophrenia go away, nor has it beenestablished thatacommunitymental-health centercan yetmaintainthementalhealthofacommunity.Theseadmi- rable institutions are demonstrably useful for the manage- ment ofcertain forms ofmental disease, but that is another matter. Mycomplaintaboutthetermsisthattheysoundtoomuch like firm promises. A Health Maintenance Organization, if well organized and financed, will have the best features of a clinic and hospital and should be ofvalue to any commu- nity, butthepeoplewillexpectittoliveuptoits new name. Itwill become, withthesignoveritsdoor, anofficial institu- tion for the distribution of health, and if intractable heart disease develops in anyone thereafter, as it surely will (or multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, or the majority of cancers that can neither be prevented nor cured, or chronicnephritis,orstroke,ormoroseness), thepeoplewill begin looking sidelongand askingquestions in alow voice. Meanwhile, we are paying too little attention, and re- spect, to the built-in durability and sheer power of the hu- man organism. Its surest tendency is toward stability and balance. It is a distortion, with something profoundly dis- loyal about it, to picture the human being as a teetering, fallible contraption, always needing watching and patching, alwayson thevergeofflappingtopieces; this isthedoctrine thatpeople hearmostoften, and mosteloquently,onallour information media. We ought to be developing a much better system for general education about human health, with more auricular time for acknowledgment, and even somecelebration,oftheabsolutemarvelofgood health that is the real lot of most of us, most of the time. The familiar questions about the needs of the future in84 The Lives ofa Cell medicinearestillbeforeus. Whatitemsshould beavailable, optimally, in an ideal health-care delivery system? How do you estimate the total need, per patient per year, for doc- tors, nurses, drugs, laboratory tests, hospital beds, x-rays, and so forth, in the best ofrational worlds? My suggestion for a new way to develop answers is to examine, in detail, the ways in which the various parts oftoday's medical-care technology are used, from one day to the next, by the most sophisticated,knowledgeable,andpresumablysatisfiedcon- — sumerswhonowhavefullaccesstothesystem namely,the well-trained, experienced, middle-aged, married-with- family internists. I could design the questionnaire myself, I think. How many times in the last five years have the members ofyour family, including yourself, had any kind oflaboratory test? How many complete physical examinations? X-rays? Elec- trocardiograms? How often, in a year's turning, have you prescribed antibiotics of any kind for yourself or your family? How many hospitalizations? How much surgery? How many consultations with a psychiatrist? How many formal visits to a doctor, any doctor, including yourself? I will bet that if you got this kind of information, and added everythingup, youwould find aquitedifferentsetof figures from the ones now beingprojected in official circles for the population at large. I have tried it already, in an unscientific way, by asking around among my friends. My data, still soft but fairly consistent, reveal that none of my internist friends have had a routine physical examination sincemilitaryservice;veryfewhave beenx-rayedexceptby dentists;almostallhaveresisted surgery; laboratorytestsfor anyone in the family are extremely rare. They use a lot of aspirin, but they seem to write very few prescriptions and almost never treat family fever with antibiotics. This is not to say that they do not become ill; these families have the same incidence of chiefly respiratory and gastrointestinalYour Very Good Health 85 illness as everyone else, the same number ofanxieties and — bizarre notions, and the same number on balance, asmall — number of frightening or devastating diseases. It will be protested that internists and their households are really full-time captive patients and cannot fairly be compared to the restofthe population. As each memberof the family appears at the breakfast table, the encounter is, in effect, a house-call. The father is, in the liveliest sense, a family doctor. This is true, but all the more reason for expecting optimal use to be made of the full range of medicine's technology. There is no problem ofaccess, the entire health-care delivery system is immediately at hand, and thecostofall items is surely less than thatfornonmedi- cal families. All the usual constraints that limit the use of medical care by the general population are absent. If my hunch, based on the small sample of professional friends, iscorrect, thesepeopleappeartousemodern medi- cine quite differently from the ways in which we have sys- tematically been educating the public over the last few decades. Itcannotbeexplained away as an instanceofshoe- makers' children going without shoes. Doctors' families do tend to complain that they receive less medical attention than their friends and neighbors, but they seem a normal, generally healthy lot, with a remarkably low incidence of iatrogenic illness. Thegreat secret, known to internists and learned early in marriage by internists' wives, but still hidden from thegen- eral public, is that most things get better by themselves. Most things, in fact, are better by morning. It is conceivable that we might be able to provide good medical care for everyone needing it, in a new system de- signed to assure equity, provided wecan restrain ourselves, orourcomputers, from designing asystem in which all 200 million of us are assumed to be in constant peril of failed health every day of our lives. In the same sense that our86 The Lives ofa Cell judicial system presumes us to be innocent until proved guilty, a medical-care system may work best ifit starts with thepresumption thatmostpeopleare healthy. Leftto them- selves, computers may try to do it in the opposite way, taking itasgiven that some sortofdirect, continual, profes- sional intervention is required all the time to maintain the health ofeach citizen, and we will end up spending all our money on nothing but that. Meanwhile, there is a long list ofother things to do if we are to change the way we live together, especially in our cities, in time. Social health is another kind of problem, more complex and urgent, and there will be other bills to pay.Social Talk Not all social animals are social with the same degree ofcommitment. In somespecies, the membersareso tied to each otherand interdependentas to seem the looselyconjoined cells ofatissue. The social insects are like this; they move, and live all their lives, in a mass; a beehive is a spherical animal. In other species, less compulsively social, the members make their homes together, pool re- sources, travel in packs or schools, and share the food, but any single one can survive solitary, detached from the rest. Others are social only in the sense of being more or less congenial, meeting from time to time in committees, using social gatherings as ad hoc occasions for feeding and breed- ing. Some animals simply nod at each other in passing, never reaching even a first-name relationship. It is not a simple thing to decide where we fit, for at one timeoranotherinourlives we manage toorganize inevery We imaginable social arrangement. are as interdependent, especially in our cities, as bees or ants, yet we can detach if we wish and go live alone in the woods, in theory anyway. We feed and look after each other, constructing elaborate systems for this, even including vending machines to dis- pense ice cream in gas stations, but we also have numerous books to tell us how to liveoffthe land. Weclusterinfamily groups, but we tend, unpredictably, to turn on each other and fight as if we were different species. Collectively, we hankertoaccumulateall theinformation intheuniverseand distribute it around among ourselves as though it were a kind ofessential foodstuff, ant-fashion (the faintest trace of real news in science has the action ofa pheromone, lifting 8788 The Lives ofa Cell the hairsofworkers in laboratoriesattheendsoftheearth), but each of us also builds a private store of his own secret knowledge and hides itaway like untouchable treasure. We have names to label each as self, and we believe without reservation that this system oftaxonomy will guarantee the entity, theabsoluteseparatenessofeachofus, butthemech- anism has nodiscerniblefunction inthecenterofacrowded city; we are essentially nameless, most of our time. Nobody wants to think that the rapidly expanding mass of mankind, spreading out over the surface of the earth, blackening the ground, bears any meaningful resemblance to the life ofan anthill or a hive. Who would consider for a moment that the more than 3 billion of us are a sort of stupendous animal when we become linked together? We are not mindless, nor is our day-to-day behavior coded out to the last detail by our genomes, nor do we seem to be engaged together, compulsively, in any single, universal, stereotyped task analogous to the construction ofa nest. If we were ever to put all our brains together in fact, to make acommonmind thewaytheantsdo, itwould beanunthink- able thought, way over our heads. Socialanimalstend tokeepataparticularthing,generally something huge for their size; they work at it ceaselessly undergenetic instructions and genetic compulsion, using it to house the species and protect it, assuring permanence. Thereare, to besure, superficial resemblances in someof the things we do together, like building glass and plastic cities on all the land and farming under the sea, or assem- bling in armies, or landing samples of ourselves on the moon, or sending memoranda into the next galaxy. We do these together without being quite sure why, but we can stop doing one thing and move to another whenever we like. We are not committed or bound by ourgenes to stick to one activity forever, like the wasps. Today's behavior is no more fixed than when we tumbled out over Europe to buildcathedralsin thetwelfthcentury. AtthattimewewereSocial Talk 89 convinced thatitwould goon forever, that this was the way to live, but it was not; indeed, most of us have already forgotten what it was all about. Anything we do in this transient, secondary social way, compulsively and with all our energies but only for a brief period of our history, cannotbecounted associal behaviorin the biological sense. Ifwecan turn iton and off, on whims, itisn't likely thatour genes are providing the detailed instructions. Constructing Chartres was good for our minds, but we found that our lives went on, and it is no more likely that we will find survival in Romeplows orlaser bombs, or rapid mass trans- port or a Mars lander, or solar power, or even synthetic protein. We do tend to improvise things like this as we go along, but it is clear that we can pick and choose. For practical purposes, it would probably be best for us not to be biologically social, in the long run. Not that we have a choice, or course, or even a vote. It would not be good news tolearnthatweareall roped togetherintellectu- ally, droning away at some featureless, genetically driven collectivework, buildingsomethingsoimmensethatwecan never see the outlines. It seems especially hard, even peril- ous, for this to be the burden ofa species with the unique attribute ofspeech, and argument. Leave this kind oflife to the insects and birds, and lesser mammals, and fish. But there is just that one thing. About human speech. It begins to look, more and more disturbingly, as if the gift of language is the single human trait that marks us all genetically, setting us apart from all the rest of life. Lan- guage is, like nest-building or hive-making, the universal and biologically specific activity of human beings. We en- gagein itcommunally,compulsively,and automatically. We cannotbehuman withoutit; ifweweretobeseparated from it our minds would die, as surely as bees lost from the hive. We are born knowing how to use language. The capacity to recognize syntax, to organize and deploy words into intelligible sentences, is innate in the human mind. We are90 The Lives ofa Cell programmed to identify patterns and generate grammar. There are invariant and variable structures in speech that are common to all of us. As chicks are endowed with an innate capacity to read information in the shapes of over- hanging shadows, telling hawk from other birds, we can identify the meaning ofgrammar in a string ofwords, and we are born this way. According to Chomsky, who has examined it as a biologist looks at live tissue, language \"must simply be a biological property ofthe human mind.\" The universal attributes oflanguage are genetically set; we do not learn them, or make them up as we go along. We work at this all our lives, and collectively we give it life, butwedonotexerttheleastcontroloverlanguage, not as individuals orcommittees or academies orgovernments. Language, once it comes alive, behaves like an active, motile organism. Parts ofit are always being changed, by a ceaseless activity to which all of us are committed; new words are invented and inserted, old ones have their mean- ingaltered orabandoned. Newwaysofstringingwordsand sentences together come into fashion and vanish again, but the underlying structure simply grows, enriches itself, ex- pands. Individual languages age away and seem to die, but they leave progeny all over the place. Separate languages can exist side by side for centuries without touching each other, maintaining their integrity with the vigor of incom- patible tissues. At other times, two languages may come together, fuse, replicate, and give rise to nests of new tongues. Iflanguage is at the core ofour social existence, holding us together, housing us in meaning, it may also be safe to say that art and music are functions of the same universal, genetically determined mechanism. These are not bad things to do together. Ifwe are social creatures because of this, and therefore like ants, I for one (or should I say we for one?) do not mind.Information According to the linguistic school currently on top, human beings are all born with a genetic endow- ment for recognizing and formulating language. This must mean that we possessgenes for all kinds ofinfor- DNA mation, with strands ofspecial, peculiarly human for thediscernmentofmeaninginsyntax. Wemustimaginethe morphogenesis ofdeep structures, built into our minds, for codingout, likeproteins, thepartsofspeech. Correctgram- mar (correct in the logical, not fashionable, sense) is as much a biologic characteristic ofour species as feathers on birds. If this is true, it would mean that the human mind is preset, in some primary sense, to generate more than just theparts ofspeech. Since everythingelse thatwe recognize as human behavior derives from the central mechanism of language, the same sets ofgenes are at least indirectly re- sponsible forgoverning such astonishing behavioras in the concert hall, where hundreds of people crowd together, silent, head-tilted, meditating, listening to music as though receiving instructions, or in agallery, movingalong slowly, peering, never looking at each other, concentrating as though reading directions. Thisviewofthingsiscompatiblewiththeveryold notion that a framework for meaning is somehow built into our minds at birth. We startour lives with templates, and attach to them, as we go along, various things that fit. There are neural centers for generating, spontaneously, numberless hypotheses about the facts oflife. We store up information 9192 The Lives ofa Cell the way cells store energy. When we are lucky enough to find a direct match between a receptor and a fact, there is a deep explosion in the mind; the idea suddenly enlarges, rounds up, bursts with new energy, and begins to replicate. At times there are chains ofreverberating explosions, shak- ing everything: the imagination, as we say, is staggered. This system seems to be restricted to human beings, since we are the only beings with language, although chimpan- zees may have the capability ofmanipulating symbols with a certain syntax. The great difference between us and the other animals may be the qualitative difference made by speech. We live by making transformations ofenergy into words, storing it up, and releasing it in controlled explo- sions. Speechless animals cannot do this sort ofthing, and they are limited to single-stage transactions. They wander, as we do, searching for facts to fit their sparser stock of hypothe- ses, but when the receptor meets its match, there is only a single thud. Without language, the energy that is encoiled, springlike, inside information can only be used once. The solitary wasp, Sphex, nearing her time ofeggs, travels aloft with a single theory about caterpillars. She is, in fact, a winged receptor for caterpillars. Finding one to match the hypothesis, she swoops, pins it, paralyzes it, carries it off, and descends to deposit it precisely in front of the door of the round burrow (which, obsessed by a different version of the same theory, she had prepared beforehand). She drops the beast, enters the burrow, inspects the interior for last-minute irregularities, thencomesouttopull itin forthe egg-laying. It has the orderly, stepwise look of a well thought-out business. But if, while she is inside inspecting, you move the caterpillar a short distance, she has a less sensible second thought about the matter. She emerges, searches for a moment, finds it, drags it back to the original spot, drops it again, and runs inside to check the burrowInformation 93 again. Ifyou move the caterpillar again, she will repeat the program, and you can keep her totally preoccupied for as long as you have the patience and the heart for it. It is a compulsive, essentially neurotic kind ofbehavior, as mind- less as an Ionesco character, but the wasp cannot imagine any other way of doing the thing. Lymphocytes, likewasps, aregeneticallyprogrammed for exploration, buteachofthemseemstobepermittedadiffer- ent, solitary idea. They roam through the tissues, sensing and monitoring. Since there are so many ofthem, they can make collectiveguesses at almost anything antigenic on the surfaceoftheearth, buttheymustdotheirworkonenotion at a time. They carry specific information in their surface receptors, presented in the form of a question: is there, anywhereoutthere, myparticularmolecularconfiguration? It seems to be in the nature of biologic information that it notonlystoresitselfupasenergy butalso instigatesasearch for more. It is an insatiable mechanism. Lymphocytes are apparently informed about everything foreign around them, and someofthem comeequipped for fittingwithpolymers thatdo notexistuntilorganicchemists synthesize them in their laboratories. Thecells can do more than predict reality; they are evidently programmed with wild guesses as well. Notall animals have lymphocytes with the same range of information, as you might expect. As with language, the system is governed by genes, and there are genetic differ- ences between species and between inbred animals of the same species. There are polymers that will fit the receptors ofone line ofguinea pigs or mice but not others; there are responders and nonresponders. When the connection is made, and a particular lym- phocyte with a particular receptor is brought into the pres- ence of the particular antigen, one of the greatest small spectacles in nature occurs. The cell enlarges, begins mak-94 The Lives ofa Cell DNA ing new atagreatrate, and turns intowhatis termed, appropriately, a blast. It then begins dividing, replicating itselfintoanewcolonyofidenticalcells,alllabeled with the same receptor, primed with the same question. The new cluster is a memory, nothing less. For this kind of mechanism to be useful, the cells are required to stick precisely to the point. Any ambiguity, any tendency to wanderfrom the matterat hand, will introduce grave hazards for the cells, and even more for the host in which they live. Minor inaccuracies may cause reactions in which neighboring cells are recognized as foreign, and done in. There is a theory that the process ofaging may be due to the cumulative effect of imprecision, a gradual de- grading of information. It is not a system that allows for deviating. Perhaps it is in this respect that language differs most sharply from other biologic systems for communication. Ambiguity seems to be an essential, indispensable element forthe transferofinformation fromoneplacetoanotherby words, where matters ofreal importance are concerned. It is often necessary, for meaning to come through, that there be an almost vague sense of strangeness and askewness. Speechless animals and cells cannotdo this. The specifically locked-on antigen at the surface ofa lymphocyte does not send the cell off in search of something totally different; when a bee is tracking sugar by polarized light, observing the sun as though consulting his watch, he does not veer away to discover an unimaginable marvel ofa flower. Only the human mind is designed to work in this way, pro- grammed to drift away in the presence oflocked-on infor- mation, straying from each point in a hunt for a better, different point. If it were not for the capacity for ambiguity, for the sensing ofstrangeness, that words in all languages provide, we would have nowayofrecognizingthe layersofcounter-Information 95 point in meaning, and we might be spending all our time sitting on stone fences, staring into the sun. To be sure, we would always have had some everyday use to make of the alphabet, and we might have reached the same capacity for small talk, but it is unlikely that we would have been able toevolvefromwordstoBach.Thegreatthingabouthuman language is that itprevents us from sticking to the matterat hand.Death in the Open Most ofthe dead animals you see on highways near the cities are dogs, a few cats. Out in the country- side, the forms and coloring of the dead are strange; these are the wild creatures. Seen from a car win- dow they appear as fragments, evoking memories ofwood- chucks, badgers, skunks, voles, snakes, sometimes the mys- terious wreckage of a deer. It is always a queer shock, part a sudden upwelling of grief, part unaccountable amazement. It is simply astound- ingtoseeananimaldeadonahighway.Theoutrageismore than just the location; it is the impropriety of such visible death, anywhere. You do notexpect to see dead animals in the open. It is the nature ofanimals to die alone, offsome- where, hidden. It is wrong to see them lying out on the highway; it is wrong to see them anywhere. Everything in the world dies, but we only know about it as a kind of abstraction. If you stand in a meadow, at the edge ofa hillside, and look around carefully, almost every- thing you can catch sight ofis in the process ofdying, and most things will be dead long before you are. Ifit were not for the constant renewal and replacement going on before your eyes, the whole place would turn to stone and sand under your feet. There are some creatures that do not seem to die at all; they simply vanish totally into their own progeny. Single cells do this. The cell becomes two, then four, and so on, and after a while the last trace is gone. It cannot be seen as death; barringmutation, thedescendantsaresimplythefirst 96Death in the Open 97 cell, livingalloveragain. Thecyclesofthe slime mold have episodes that seem as conclusive as death, but the withered slug, with its stalk and fruiting body, is plainly the transient tissue of a developing animal; the free-swimming amebo- cytes use this organ collectively in order to produce more of themselves. There are said to be a billion billion insects on the earth at any moment, most ofthem with very short life expectan- cies byourstandards. Someone hasestimated that there are 25 million assorted insects hanging in the air over every temperate square mile, in a column extending upward for thousands offeet, drifting through the layers ofthe atmos- pherelikeplankton. Theyaredyingsteadily, somebybeing eaten, some just dropping in their tracks, tons of them around the earth, disintegrating as they die, invisibly. Who ever sees dead birds, in anything like the huge numbersstipulated bythecertaintyofthedeathofall birds? A dead bird is an incongruity, more startling than an unex- pected live bird, sure evidence to the human mind that something has gone wrong. Birds do their dying offsome- where, behind things, under things, never on the wing. Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, mostconspicuousones find ways to conceal themselves in time. Ifan elephant missteps and dies in anopenplace, the herd will notleavehim there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suit- able location. When elephants encounter the skeleton ofan elephant out in the open, they methodically take upeach of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All ofthe life ofthe earth dies, all ofthe time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see ofthis is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor ofthe summer98 The Lives ofa Cell houseinOctober,thefragmentonthehighway. Ihavelived all my life with an embarrassment ofsquirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel. Isupposeitisjustaswell. Iftheearthwereotherwise,and all the dying were done in the open, with the dead there to be looked at, we would neverhave itoutofour minds. We can forget about it much of the time, or think of it as an accident to be avoided, somehow. But it does make the processofdyingseem moreexceptional thanitreallyis,and harder to engage in at the times when we must ourselves engage. In our way, we conform as best we can to the rest of nature. The obituary pages tell us of the news that we are dying away, while the birth announcements in finer print, offat the side of the page, inform us ofour replacements, butwegetnograspfromthisoftheenormityofscale.There are 3 billion of us on the earth, and all 3 billion must be dead,onaschedule, within this lifetime. Thevastmortality, involving something over 50 million ofus each year, takes place in relative secrecy. We can only really know of the deaths in our households, or among our friends. These, detached in our minds from all the rest, we take to be unnaturalevents,anomalies,outrages. Wespeakofourown dead in low voices; struck down, we say, as though visible death can only occur for cause, by disease or violence, avoidably. We send off for flowers, grieve, make ceremo- nies, scatter bones, unaware ofthe rest of the 3 billion on the same schedule. All of that immense mass of flesh and bone and consciousness will disappear by absorption into the earth, without recognition by the transient survivors. Less than a halfcentury from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion thatDeath in the Open 99 death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. Wewillneed tolearn moreaboutthecyclingoflife in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everythingthatcomesaliveseemstobeintradefor something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition ofsynchrony, in the information that we all go down together, in the best ofcompany.Natural Science The essential wildnessofscienceasamanifestationof human behavior is not generally perceived. As we extract new things of value from it, we also keep discovering parts ofthe activity that seem in need ofbetter control, more efficiency, less unpredictability. We'd like to pay less for it and get our money's worth on some more orderly, businesslike schedule. The Washington planners are trying to be helpful in this, and there are new programs forthecentralized organizationofscienceallovertheplace, especially in the biomedical field. Itneedsthinkingabout. Thereisanalmostungovernable, biologic mechanism atworkinscientific behavioratits best, and this should not be overlooked. Thedifficulties are more conspicuous when theproblems are very hard and complicated and the facts not yet in. Solutionscannot be arrived atforproblemsofthissortuntil the science has been lifted through apreliminary, turbulent zone of outright astonishment. Therefore, what must be planned for, in the laboratories engaged in the work, is the totally unforeseeable. Ifit is centrally organized, the system must be designed primarily for the elicitation of disbelief and the celebration of surprise. Moreover, the whole scientific enterprise must be ar- ranged so that the separate imaginations in different human minds can be pooled, and this is more a kind ofgame than a systematic business. It is in the abrupt, unaccountable aggregationofrandomnotions,intuitions, knowninscience 100Natural Science 101 as good ideas, that the high points are made. The most mysterious aspect ofdifficult science is the way it is done. Not the routine, not just the fitting together of things that no one had guessed at fitting, not the making of connections; these are merely the workaday details, the methods ofoperating. They are interesting, but not as fas- cinating as the central mystery, which is that we do it at all, and that we do it under such compulsion. I don't know of any other human occupation, even in- cluding what I have seen of art, in which the people en- gaged in it are so caught up, so totally preoccupied, so driven beyond their strength and resources. Scientists at work have the look of creatures following genetic instructions; they seem to be under the influence of a deeply placed human instinct. They are, despite their efforts at dignity, rather like young animals engaged in savage play. When they are near to an answer their hair stands on end, they sweat, they are awash in their own adrenalin. To grab the answer, and grab it first, is for them a morepowerful drive than feedingor breedingorprotect- ing themselves against the elements. It sometimes looks like a lonely activity, but it is as much the opposite of lonely as human behavior can be. There is nothing so social, so communal, so interdependent. An ac- tive field of science is like an immense intellectual anthill; the individual almost vanishes into the mass ofminds tum- bling over each other, carrying information from place to place, passing it around at the speed of light. There are special kinds of information that seem to be chemotactic. As soon as a trace is released, receptors at the back of the neck are caused to tremble, there is a massive convergence of motile minds flying upwind on a gradient ofsurprise, crowding around the source. It is an infiltration of intellects, an inflammation. There is nothing to touch the spectacle. In the midst of what seems a collective derangement of minds in total,dis-102 The Lives ofa Cell order, with bits ofinformation being scattered about, torn to shreds, disintegrated, reconstituted, engulfed, in a kind ofactivity that seems as random and agitated as thatofbees inadisturbedpartofthehive,theresuddenlyemerges,with the purity ofa slow phrase ofmusic, a single new piece of truth about nature. In short, it works. It is the mostpowerful and productive ofthe things human beings have learned to do together in manycenturies,moreeffectivethanfarming,orhuntingand fishing, or building cathedrals, or making money. Itis instinctive behavior, in my view, and I do notunder- stand how it works. Itcannot be prearranged in anyprecise way; the minds cannot be lined up in tidy rows and given directions from printed sheets. You cannot get it done by instructing each mind to make this or thatpiece, forcentral committees to fit with the pieces made by other instructed minds. It does not work this way. What it needs is for the air to be made right. Ifyou want a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigationorcarbohydratechemistry,youputhimtogether with other bees (and you'd better do this quickly, for soli- tary bees do not stay alive) and you do what you can to arrange thegeneral environmentaround the hive. Iftheair is right, the science will come in its own season, like pure honey. There is something like aggression in the activity, but it differsfromotherformsofaggressivebehaviorinhavingno sort ofdestruction as the objective. While it is going on, it looks and feels like aggression: get at it, uncover it, bring it out, grab it, it's mine! It is like a primitive running hunt, but there is nothing at the end of it to be injured. More probably, the end is a sigh. But then, ifthe air is right and the science is going well, the sigh is immediately inter- rupted, there isayawping newquestion, and thewild, tum- blingactivitybeginsoncemore,outofcontrolalloveragain.Man Natural The social scientists, especially the economists, are moving deeply into ecology and the environment these days, with disquieting results. It goes some- how against the grain to learn that cost-benefit analyses can be done neatly on lakes, meadows, nesting gannets, even whole oceans. It is hard enough to confront the environ- mentaloptionsahead,andthehardchoices, butevenharder when the price tags are so visible. Even the new jargon is disturbing: it hurts the spirit, somehow, to read the word environments, when the plural means that there are so many alternatives there to be sorted through, as in a market, and voted on. Economists need cool heads and cold hearts for this sort of work, and they must write in icy, often skiddy prose. The degree to which we are all involved in the control of the earth's life is just beginning to dawn on most ofus, and it means another revolution for human thought. This will not come easily. We've just made our way through inconclusive revolutions on the same topic, trying to make up our minds how we feel about nature. As soon as we arrived at one kind of consensus, like an enormous committee, wefound itwas timetothinkitthroughallover, and now here we are, at it again. The oldest, easiest-to-swallow idea was that the earth was man's personal property, a combination of garden, zoo, bank vault, and energy source, placed at our disposal to be consumed, ornamented, or pulled apart as we wished. The betterment ofmankind was, as we understood it, the whole 103104 The Lives ofa Cell pointofthething. Masteryovernature, mysteryandall,was a moral duty and social obligation. In the last few years we were wrenched away from this way oflooking at it, and arrived at something like general agreement that we had it wrong. We still argue the details, but it is conceded almost everywhere that we are not the masters ofnature that we thought ourselves; we are as de- pendentontherestoflifeasaretheleavesormidgesorfish. Wearepartofthesystem. Onewaytoputitisthattheearth is a loosely formed, spherical organism, with all its working parts linked in symbiosis. Weare, in thisview, neitherown- ers nor operators; at best, we might see ourselves as motile — tissuespecializedforreceivinginformation perhaps, inthe best ofall possible worlds, functioning as a nervous system for the whole being. There is, for some, too much dependency in this view, and they prefer to see us as a separate, qualitatively differ- ent,specialspecies, unlikeanyotherformoflife,despitethe sharingaround ofgenes, enzymes, and organelles. No mat- ter, there is still the underlying idea that we cannot have a life ofour own withoutconcern for the ecosystem in which we live, whether in majesty or not. This idea has been strong enough to launch the new movements for the suste- nance ofwilderness, the protection ofwildlife, the turning off of insatiable technologies, the preservation of \"whole earth.\" Butnow,justwhenthenewviewseemstobetakinghold, we may be in foranotherwrench, this time moredismaying and unsettling than anything we've come through. In a sense, we shall be obliged to swing back again, still believ- ingin thenewway butconstrained by thefactsoflifetolive in the old. It may be too late, as things have turned out. We are, in fact, the masters, like it or not. Itisadespairingprospect. Hereweare,practicallyspeak- ing twenty-first-century mankind, filled to exuberance withNatural Man 105 our new understanding of kinship to all the family of life, andhereweare,stillnineteenth-centuryman,walkingboot- shodovertheopenfaceofnature,subjugatingandcivilizing it. And we cannot stop this controlling, unless we vanish under the hill ourselves. If there were such a thing as a world mind, it should crack over this. The truth is, we have become moredeeply involved than we ever dreamed. The fact that we sit around as we do, worryingseriouslyabouthowbesttopreservethelifeofthe earth, is itself the sharpest measure ofour involvement. It is not human arrogance that has taken us in this direction, but the most natural of natural events. We developed this way, we grew this way, we are this kind of species. We have become, in a painful, unwished-for way, nature itself. We have grown into everywhere, spreading like a new growth over the entire surface, touching and affecting every other kind of life, incorporating ourselves. The earth risks being eutrophied by us. We are now the dominant feature ofour own environment. Humans, large terrestrial metazoans, fired by energy from microbial symbionts lodged in their cells, instructed by tapes of nucleic acid stretching back to theearliest live membranes, informed by neurons essentially the same as all the other neurons on earth, sharing structures with mastodons and lichens, living offthe sun, are now in charge, running the place, for better or worse. Or is it really this way? It could be, you know, just the other way around. Perhaps we are the invaded ones, the subjugated, used. Certain animals in the sea live by becoming part-animal, part-plant. They engulf algae, which then establish them- selves as complex plant tissues, essential for the life of the whole company. I suppose the giant clam, if he had more ofa mind, would have moments ofdismay on seeing what he has done to the plant world, incorporating so much of106 The Lives ofa Cell it, enslaving green cells, living off the photosynthesis. But the plant cells would take a different view of it, having captured the clam on the most satisfactory ofterms, includ- ingthesmall lenses in histissues thatfocussunlightfortheir benefit; perhaps algae have bad moments about what they may collectively be doing to the world of clams. With luck,ourownsituation mightbesimilar,onalarger scale. This might turn out to be a special phase in the mor- phogenesis ofthe earth when it is necessary to have some- thing like us, for a time anyway, to fetch and carry energy, look after new symbiotic arrangements, store up informa- tion for some future season, do a certain amount oforna- menting, maybe even carry seeds around the solar system. That kind of thing. Handyman for the earth. I would much prefer this useful role, ifI had any say, to theessentially unearthlycreaturewe seemotherwiseon the way to becoming. Itwould mean making somequitefunda- mental changes in our attitudes toward each other, if we were really to think ofourselves as indispensable elements of nature. We would surely become the environment to worryaboutthe most. Wewould discover, inourselves, the sources ofwonderment and delight that we have discerned in all other manifestationsofnature. Who knows, we might evenacknowledgethefragilityandvulnerabilitythatalways accompany high specialization in biology, and movements might start up for the protection ofourselves as a valuable, endangered species. We couldn't lose.The Iks The small tribeofIks, formerly nomadic hunters and gatherers in the mountain valleys of northern Uganda, have become celebrities, literary symbols for the ultimate fate ofdisheartened, heartless mankind at large. Two disastrously conclusive things happened to them: the government decided to have a national park, so they were compelled by law to give up hunting in the val- leysand becomefarmersonpoorhillsidesoil,and thenthey were visited for two years by an anthropologist who de- tested them and wrote a book about them. The messageofthe book is thatthe Iks have transformed themselves into an irreversibly disagreeable collection of unattached, brutish creatures, totally selfish and loveless, in response to the dismantling of their traditional culture. Moreover, this is what the rest of us are like in our inner selves,andwewillallturnintoIkswhenthestructureofour society comes all unhinged. The argument rests, of course, on certain assumptions about the core ofhuman beings, and is necessarily specula- tive. You have to agree in advance that man is fundamen- tally a bad lot, out for himselfalone, displaying suchgraces as affection and compassion only as learned habits. If you take this view, the story of the Iks can be used to confirm it. These people seem to be living together, clustered in small, dense villages, but they are really solitary, unrelated individuals with no evident use for each other. They talk, but only to make ill-tempered demands and cold refusals. They share nothing. They never sing. They turn the chil- 107108 The Lives ofa Cell dren out to forage as soon as they can walk, and desert the elders to starve whenever they can, and the foraging chil- dren snatch food from the mouths ofthe helpless elders. It is a mean society. They breed without love or even casual regard. They defecateon each other's doorsteps. Theywatch theirneigh- bors for signs ofmisfortune, and only then do they laugh. In the book they do a lot oflaughing, having so much bad luck. Several times theyeven laughed attheanthropologist, who found this especially repellent (one senses, between the lines, that the scholar is not himselfthe world's luckiest man). Worse, they took him into the family, snatched his food, defecated on his doorstep, and hooted dislike at him. They gave him two bad years. It is a depressing book. If, as he suggests, there is only Ikness at the centerofeach ofus, oursole hopeforhanging on tothenameofhumanitywillbeinendlesslymendingthe structure of our society, and it is changing so quickly and completely that we may never find the threads in time. Meanwhile, lefttoourselvesalone, solitary, wewill become the same joyless, zestless, untouching lone animals. But this may be too narrow aview. Forone thing, the Iks are extraordinary. They are absolutely astonishing, in fact. The anthropologist has never seen people like them any- where, nor have I. You'd think, ifthey were simply exam- ples ofthe common essence ofmankind, they'd seem more recognizable. Instead, they are bizarre, anomalous. I have known my share ofpeculiar, difficult, nervous, grabby peo- ple, but I've neverencountered anygenuinely, consistently detestable human beings in all my life. The Iks sound more like abnormalities, maladies. I cannot accept it. I do not believe that the Iks are repre- sentative of isolated, revealed man, unobscured by social habits. I believe their behavior is something extra, some- thing laid on. This unremitting, compulsive repellence is aThe Iks 109 kind of complicated ritual. They must have learned to act this way; they copied it, somehow. I have a theory, then. The Iks have gone crazy. The solitary Ik, isolated in the ruins ofan exploded cul- ture, has built a new defense for himself. If you live in an unworkable society you can make up one ofyourown, and this is what the Iks have done. Each Ik has become agroup, a one-man tribe on its own, a constituency. Now everything falls into place. This is why they do seem, after all, vaguely familiar to all of us. We've seen them before. This is precisely the waygroups ofone size or another, ranging from committees to nations, behave. It is, ofcourse, thisaspectofhumanitythathas lagged behind the rest ofevolution, and this is why the Ik seems so primitive. In his absolute selfishness, his incapacity to give anything away, no matter what, he is a successful committee. When he stands at the door of his hut, shouting insults at his neighbors in a loud harangue, he is city addressing another city. Cities have all the Ik characteristics. They defecate on doorsteps, in rivers and lakes, their own or anyone else's. They leave rubbish. They detestall neighboringcities, give nothing away. They even build institutions for deserting elders out of sight. Nations are the most Iklike of all. No wonder the Iks seem familiar. For total greed, rapacity, heartlessness, and irresponsibility there is nothing to match a nation. Nations, by law, are solitary, self-centered, withdrawn into them- selves. There is no such thing as affection between nations, and certainly no nation ever loved another. They bawl in- sults from their doorsteps, defecate into whole oceans, snatch all the food, survive by detestation, take joy in the bad luckofothers, celebrate thedeath ofothers, liveforthe death of others. That's it,and I shallstopworryingaboutthebook. Itdoes110 The Lives ofa Cell notsignify thatman is asparse, inhuman thingathiscenter. He's all right. It only says what we've always known and never had enough time to worry about, that we haven't yet learned how to stay human when assembled in masses. The Ik, in his despair, is acting out this failure, and perhaps we should pay closer attention. Nations have themselves be- come too frightening to think about, but we might learn some things by watching these people.Computers You can make computers that are almost human. In some respects they are superhuman; they can beat most of us at chess, memorize whole telephone booksataglance,composemusicofacertain kind and write obscurepoetry, diagnoseheartailments, send personal invi- tations tovastparties, evengotransientlycrazy. Noone has yet programmed a computer to be of two minds about a hard problem, or to burstout laughing, but that may come. Sooner or later, there will be real human hardware, great whirring,clickingcabinets intelligentenough toread maga- zines and vote, able to think rings around the rest of us. Well, maybe, but not for a while anyway. Before we begin organizing sanctuaries and reservations for our soft- ware selves, lestwevanish likethewhales, here isathought to relax with. Even when technology succeeds in manufacturing a ma- chine as big as Texas to do everything we recognize as human, it will still be, at best, a single individual. This amounts tonothing, practicallyspeaking. Tomatch whatwe can do, there would have to be 3 billion ofthem with more coming down the assembly line, and I doubt that anyone will put up the money, much less make room. And even so, they would all have to be wired together, intricately and delicately, as we are, communicating with each other, talk- ing incessantly, listening. Ifthey weren't at each other this way, all their waking hours, they wouldn't be anything like human, after all. I think we're safe, for a long time ahead. It is in our collective behavior that we are most mysteri- 111112 The Lives ofa Cell We ous. won't be able to construct machines like ourselves until we've understood this, and we're not even close. All we know is the phenomenon: we spend our time sending messages to each other, talking and trying to listen at the same time, exchanging information. This seems to be our most urgent biological function; it is what we do with our lives. By the time we reach the end, each ofus has taken in a staggering store, enough to exhaust any computer, much ofit incomprehensible, and wegenerally manage toputout even more than we take in. Information is our source of energy; we are driven by it. It has become a tremendous enterprise, a kind ofenergy system on its own. All 3 billion ofus are being connected by telephones, radios, television sets, airplanes, satellites, harangues on public-address sys- tems, newspapers, magazines, leaflets dropped from great heights, words got in edgewise. We are becoming agrid, a circuitry around the earth. Ifwe keep at it, we will become a computer to end all computers, capable of fusing all the thoughts of the world into a syncytium. Already, therearenoclosed, two-wayconversations. Any word you speak this afternoon will radiate out in all direc- tions, around town before tomorrow, out and around the world before Tuesday, accelerating to the speed of light, modulating as it goes, shaping new and unexpected mes- sages, emerging at the end as an enormously funny Hun- garian joke, a fluctuation in the money market, a poem, or simply a long pause in someone's conversation in Brazil. We do a lot of collective thinking, probably more than any other social species, although it goes on in something like secrecy. We don't acknowledge the gift publicly, and we are not as celebrated as the insects, but we do it. Effort- lessly, withoutgivingitamoment'sthought, wearecapable of changing our language, music, manners, morals, enter- tainment, even the way we dress, all around the earth in a year's turning. We seem to do this by general agreement, without voting or even polling. We simply think our wayComputers 113 along, pass information around, exchange codes disguised as art, change our minds, transform ourselves. Computers cannotdeal with such levels ofimprobability, and it is just as well. Otherwise, we might be tempted to take over the control of ourselves in order to make long- rangeplans,and thatwould surelybetheendofus. Itwould mean thatsomegrouporother, marvelously intelligentand superbly informed, undoubtedly guided by a computer, would begin deciding what human society ought to be like, say, over the next five hundred years or so, and the rest of us would be persuaded, one way or another, to go along. Theprocessofsocialevolution would thengrind toastand- still, and we'd be stuck in today's rut for a millennium. Much better we work our way out of it on our own, without governance. The future is too interesting and dan- gerous to be entrusted to any predictable, reliable agency. We need all the fallibility we can get. Most ofall, we need topreserve theabsolute unpredictability and total improba- bility ofour connected minds. That way we can keep open all the options, as we have in the past. It would be nice to have better ways ofmonitoring what we're up to so that we could recognize change while it is occurring, instead ofwaking up as we do now to the aston- ished realizationthatthewholecenturyjustpastwasn'twhat we thought it was, at all. Maybe computers can be used to help in this, although I ratherdoubt it. You can make simu- lation models ofcities, but what you learn is that they seem to be beyond the reach of intelligent analysis; ifyou try to use common sense to make predictions, things get more botched up than ever. This is interesting, since a city is the most concentrated aggregation of humans, all exerting whatever influence they can bring to bear. The city seems to have a life ofits own. Ifwe cannot understand how this works, we are not likely to get very far with human society at large. Still, you'd think there would be some way in. Joined114 The Lives ofa Cell together, the great mass ofhuman minds around the earth seems to behave like acoherent, living system. The trouble We is that the flowofinformation is mostlyone-way. areall obsessed by the need to feed information in, as fast as we can, but we lack sensing mechanisms for getting anything much back. I will confess that I have no more senseofwhat goes on in the mind of mankind than I have for the mind of an ant. Come to think of it, this might be a good place to start.The Planning of Science isgenerallyaccepted thatthebiologicsciencesareabso- It lutelysplendid. In justthepastdecade, they haveuncov- ered a huge mass of brand-new information, and there is plenty more ahead; the biologic revolution is evidently still in its early stages. Everyone approves. By contrast, the public view of the progress of medicine during the same period is restrained, qualified,amixtureofhopeand worry. For all the new knowledge, we still have formidable dis- eases, still unsolved, lacking satisfactory explanation, lack- ing satisfactory treatment. Why, it is asked, does the supply ofnew miracle drugs lag so far behind, while biology con- tinues to move from strength to strength, elaborating new, powerful technologiesforexplaining, infinedetail, thevery processes of life? It doesn't seem to help to apply the inclusive term \"bi- omedical\" to our science, much as we would like to show that we are all one field of inquiry, share and share alike. Thereisstill theconspicuousasymmetry betweenmolecular biologyand,say, thetherapyoflungcancer. Wemayaswell face up to it: there is a highly visible difference between the pace ofbasic science and the application ofnew knowledge to human problems. It needs explaining. This is an especially lively problem at the moment, be- cause of the immediate implications for national science policy. It is administratively fashionable in Washington to attribute the delay ofapplied science in medicine to a lack 115116 The Lives ofa Cell ofsystematic planning. Under a new kind ofmanagement, it is said, with more businesslike attention to the invention of practical applications, we should arrive at our targets more quickly and, it is claimed as a bonus, more economi- cally. Targeting is the new word. We need more targeted research, more mission-oriented science. And maybe less — basic research maybe considerably less. This is said to be the new drift. One trouble with this view is that it attributes to biology and medicine a much greater store of usable information, with coherence and connectedness, than actually exists. In real life, the biomedical sciences have not yet reached the stage of any kind ofgeneral applicability to disease mech- anisms. In some respects we are like the physical sciencesof the early twentieth century, booming along into new terri- tory, but without an equivalent for the engineering ofthat time. It is possible that we are on the verge ofdeveloping a proper applied science, but it has to be said that we don't have one yet. The important question before the policy- makers iswhetherthis should beallowed tooccurnaturally, as amatterofcourse, orwhetheritcan beordered up more quickly, under the influence of management and money. There are risks. We may be asking for more ofthe kind oftrouble with which we are already too familiar. There is atrapherethathasenmeshed medicineforall the millennia ofits professional existence. It has been ourperpetual habit to try anything, on the slimmest ofchances, the thinnest of hopes, empirically and wishfully, and we have proved to ourselves over and over again that the approach doesn't work well. Bleeding, cupping, and purging are the classical illustrations, butwehaveplentyofmore recentexamples to beembarrassed about. Wehave been hoaxed alongbycom- parable substitutes for technology right up to the present. There is no question about ourgood intentions in this mat- ter: we all hanker, collectively, to become applied scientistsThe Planning ofScience 117 as soon as we can, overnight if possible. Ittakessomedoing, however. Everyoneforgetshowlong and hard the work must be before the really important applications become applicable. The great contemporary achievementofmodern medicine is the technology forcon- trolling and preventing bacterial infection, but this did not fall into our laps with the appearance ofpenicillin and the sulfonamides. Ithad its beginningsin thefinalquarterofthe last century, and decades of the most painstaking and de- manding research were required before the etiology of pneumonia, scarlet fever, meningitis, and the rest could be worked out. Generations of energetic and imaginative in- vestigators exhausted their whole lives on the problems. It overlooks a staggering amount ofbasic research to say that modern medicine began with the era of antibiotics. We havetoface, inwhateverdiscomfort,therealpossibil- ity that the level of insight into the mechanisms of today's — unsolved diseases schizophrenia, for instance, or cancer, — or stroke is comparable to the situation for infectious dis- ease in 1875, with similarly crucial bits ofinformation still unencountered. We could be that far away, in the work to be done ifnot in the years to be lived through. Ifthis is the prospect, or anything like this, all ideas about better ways to speed things up should be given open-minded, close scrutiny. Long-rangeplanning and organization on anational scale are obviously essential. There is nothing unfamiliar about this; indeed, we've been engaged in a coordinated national effort for over two decades, through the established pro- cessesoftheNational InstitutesofHealth. Today'squestion is whethertheplansaresharply focused enough, theorgani- zation sufficiently tight. Do we need a new system of re- search management, with all the targets in clear display, arranged to be aimed at? This would seem reassuring and tidy, and there are some118 The Lives ofa Cell important disease problems for which it has already been done effectively, demonstrating that the direct, frontal ap- proach does work. Poliomyelitis is the most spectacular ex- ample. Once it had been learned (from basic research) that therewerethreeantigenictypesofvirusand thattheycould be abundantlygrown in tissueculture, itbecameacertainty thatavaccinecould be made. Notto say that the job would be easy, or in need ofany less rigorand sophistication than the previous research; simply that it could be done. Given the assumption that experiments would be carried out with technical perfection, the vaccine was a sure thing. It was an elegant demonstration ofhow to organize applied science, and for this reason it would have been a surprise ifit had not succeeded. This is the element that distinguishes applied science frombasic. Surpriseiswhatmakesthedifference. Whenyou are organized to apply knowledge, set up targets, produce a usable product, you require a high degree of certainty from the outset. All the facts on which you base protocols must be reasonably hard facts with unambiguous meaning. The challenge is to plan the work and organize the workers so that it will come outprecisely as predicted. For this, you need centralized authority, elaborately detailed time schedules, and some sort ofreward system based on speed and perfection. But most of all you need the intelligible basic facts to begin with, and these must come from basic research. There is no other source. In basic research, everything is just the opposite. What you need at the outset is a high degree of uncertainty; otherwise it isn't likely to be an important problem. You start with an incomplete roster of facts, characterized by their ambiguity; often the problem consists ofdiscovering the connections between unrelated pieces of information. Youmustplanexperimentsonthebasisofprobability,even barepossibility,ratherthancertainty. Ifanexperimentturns outpreciselyaspredicted,thiscanbeverynice, butitisonlyThe Planning ofScienee 119 a great event if at the same time it is a surprise. You can measure thequalityofthework by the intensityofastonish- ment. The surprise can be because it did turn out as pre- dicted (in some lines of research, 1 per cent is accepted as ahighyield),oritcan beconfoundmentbecausethepredic- tion was wrong and something totally unexpected turned up, changing the look ofthe problem and requiring a new kind ofprotocol. Either way, you win. I believe, on hunch, that an inventory ofour major dis- ease problems based on this sort of classification would showalimited numberofimportantquestionsforwhichthe predictableanswerscarrycertainty. Itmight beagood idea, when commissions go to work laying out long-range plans fordisease-oriented research,forthesequestionstobeiden- tified and segregated from all the rest, and the logic of operations research should be invaluable for this purpose. There will be lotsofdisputingamongtheexpertsoverwhat is certain and what not; perhaps the heat and duration of dispute could be adapted for the measurement of uncer- tainty. In any case, once a setofsuitable questions becomes agreed upon, these can be approached by the most system- atic methods of applied science. However, I have a stronger hunch that the greatest part ofthe important biomedical research waiting to be done is in the class ofbasic science. There is an abundance ofinter- esting fact relating toall ourmajordiseases, and more items of information are coming in steadily from all quarters in biology. The new mass of knowledge is still formless, in- complete, lacking the essential threads of connection, dis- playing misleading signals at every turn, riddled with blind alleys. Thereare fascinating ideasall overtheplace, irresist- ible experiments beyond numbering, all sorts ofnew ways into the maze of problems. But every next move is un- predictable, every outcome uncertain. It is a puzzling time, but a very good time. I do not know how you layoutorderly plans for this kind120 The Lives ofa Cell of activity, but I suppose you could find out by looking through the disorderly records of the past hundred years. Somehow, theatmospherehas tobesetsothatadisquieting senseofbeingwrongis the normal attitudeofthe investiga- tors. It has to be taken for granted that the only way in is by riding the unencumbered human imagination, with the specialrigorrequiredforrecognizingthatsomethingcanbe highly improbable, maybe almost impossible, and at the same time true. Locally, a good way to tell how the work is going is to listen in the corridors.

The thought comes that Western civilized,scientific,technologicsocietyisastandingproofof human progress, in having risen above such imaginings. They are as obsolete as the old anecdotes in which they played their puzzling, ambiguous roles, and we have no more need for the beasts than for the stories. The Griffon, Phoenix, Centaur, Sphinx, Manticore, Ganesha, Ch'i-lin, and all the rest are like recurrent bad dreams, and we are well rid of them. So we say. The trouble is that they are in fact like dreams, and not necessarily bad ones, and we may have a hard time doing without them. They may be as essential for society as myth- ologyitself, asloaded withsymbols, and asnecessaryforthe architecture ofourcollective unconscious. IfLevi-Strauss is right, myths are constructed by a universal logic that, like language itself, is as characteristic for human beingsas nest- buildingisforbirds.Thestoriesseemtobedifferentstories, but the underlying structure is always the same, in any part ofthe world, at any time. They are like engrams, built into our genes. In this sense, bestiaries are part of our inheri- tance. There is something basically similar about most ofthese crazyanimals. Theyareall unbiologic, butunbiologic in the same way. Bestiaries do not contain, as a rule, totally novel 121122 The Lives ofa Cell creatures ofthe imagination made up ofparts that we have never seen before. On the contrary, they are made up of parts that are entirely familiar. What is novel, and startling, is that they are mixtures of species. It is perhaps this characteristic that makes the usual besti- ary so outlandish to the twentieth-century mind. Our most powerful story, equivalent in its way to a universal myth, is evolution. Nevermind thatitis truewhereasmythsarenot; it is filled with symbolism, and this is the way it has in- fluenced the mind of society. In our latest enlightenment, — the fabulous beasts are worse than improbable they are impossible, because they violate evolution. They are not species, and they deny the existence of species. The Phoenix comes the closest to being a conventional animal, all bird for all ofits adult life. It is, in fact, the most exuberant, elaborate, and ornamented ofall plumed birds. It exists in the mythology of Egypt, Greece, the Middle East, and Europe, and is the same as the vermilion bird of ancient China. It lives for five hundred triumphant years, and when it dies it constructs a sort ofegg-shaped cocoon around itself. Inside, it disintegrates and gives rise to a wormlikecreature, which thendevelops intothenewPhoe- nix, ready forthe nextfive hundred years. Inotherversions the dead bird bursts into flames, and the new one arises fromtheashes, butthewormstoryisveryold,toldnodoubt by an early biologist. Therearesomanyexamplesofhybrid beingsinbestiaries that you could say that an ardent belief in mixed forms of life is an ancienthuman idea, orthatsomethingelse, deeply believed in, is symbolized by these consortia. They are dis- turbing to look at, nightmarish, but most of them, oddly enough, are intended as lucky benignities. TheCh'i-lin, for instance, out ofancient China, has the body ofa deer cov- ered with gleaming scales, a marvelous bushy tail, cloven hooves, and small horns. Whoever saw a Ch'i-lin was inSome Biomythology 123 luck, and if you got to ride one, you had it made. TheGaneshaisoneoftheoldestand mostfamiliarHindu deities, possessing afathuman body, four human arms, and the head ofacheerful-lookingelephant.

TheManticorehasalion'sbody,aman'sface,andatailwith avenomous snake's head at the end ofit. It bounds around seeking prey with huge claws and three rows ofteeth, but it makes the sounds of a beautiful silver flute. Some ofthe animal myths have the ring ofcontemporary biologic theory, if you allow for differences in jargon. An ancient idea in India postulates an initial Being, the first form of life on the earth, analogous to our version of the earliest prokaryotic arrangement of membrane-limited nu- cleic acid, the initial cell, born of lightning and methane. The Indian Being, undefined and indefinable, finding itself alone, fearing death, yearning forcompany, began to swell in size, rearranged itself inside, and then split into two identical halves. Oneofthesechanged intoacow, theother a bull, and they mated, then changed again to a mare and stallion, and so on, down to theants, and thus the earth was populated. There is alotofoversimplification here, and too much shorthand for modern purposes, but the essential myth is recognizable. Theserpentkeeps recurringthrough theearliestcyclesof mythology, always as a central symbol for the life of the universeand thecontinuityofcreation. Thereare twogreat identical snakesonaLevantinelibationvaseofaround 2000 B.C., coiled around each other in adouble helix, represent- ing the original generation oflife. They are the replicated parts ofthe first source of living, and they are wonderfully homologous. There is a Peruvian deity, painted on a clay pot dating124 The Lives ofa Cell from around A.D. 300, believed to be responsible for guarding farms. His hair is made of snakes, entwined in braids, with wings forhis headdress. Plantsofvarious kinds are growing out of his sides and back, and a vegetable of some sort seems to begrowing from his mouth. The whole effect is wild and disheveled but essentially friendly. He is, in fact, an imaginary version of a genuine animal, symbio- pholus, described in Nature several years back, a species of weevil in the mountains ofnorthern New Guinea that lives symbiotically with dozens ofplants, growing in the niches andcleftsinitscarapace, rootedallthewaydowntoitsflesh, plus a whole ecosystem of mites, rotifers, nematodes, and bacteria attached to the garden. The weevil could be taken foragood-luckomen on itsown evidence; it is notattacked by predators, it lives a long, untroubled life, and nothing elsewilleatit, eitherbecauseofsomethingdistasteful inthe system or simply because of the ambiguity. The weevil is only about thirty millimeters long, easilyoverlooked, butit has the makings of a myth. Perhaps we should be looking around for other candi- dates. I suggesttheneedforanewbestiary, totaketheplace of the old ones. I can think of several creatures that seem designedforthisfunction,ifyouwillacceptamicrobestiary, and if you are looking for metaphors. Firstofall, thereis Myxotrichaparadoxa. This is theproto- zoan, not yet as famous as he should be, who seems to be telling us everything abouteverything, all atonce. His cilia arenotciliaatall, butindividualspirochetes,andatthebase of attachment of each spirochete is an oval organelle, em- bedded in the myxotrichamembrane, which isabacterium. — It is notan animal afterall it isacompany, an assemblage. The story told by myxotricha is as deep as any myth, as profoundly allusive. This creature has lagged behind the rest of us, and is still going through the process of being assembled. Our cilia gave up any independent existenceSome Biomythology 125 long ago, and our organelles are now truly ours, but the genomes controlling separate parts ofour cells are still dif- ferent genomes, lodged in separate compartments; doctri- nally, we are still assemblages. There is another protozoan, called blepharisma, telling a long story about the chanciness and fallibility of complex life. Blepharisma is called that because of a conspicuous fringe ofciliated membranes around the oral cavity, which evidentlyreminded someoneofeyelashes (blepbaridos). The whole mythlike tale has been related in a book by Giese. Blepharismahascomemuch furtheralongthan myxotricha, but not far enough to be free of slip-ups. There are three DNA different sets of self-duplicating nuclei, with the in each set serving different purposes: a large macronucleus, governing the events in regeneration after injury, a set of eight or more micronuclei containing the parts of the genome needed for reproduction, and great numbers of tiny nuclei from which the cilia arise. One part of the organism produces a pinkish pigment, now called blepharismin, which is similar to hypericin and certainotherphotosensitizingplantpigments. Blepharismin causes no trouble unless the animal swims into sunlight, but then the pigment kills it outright. Under certain circum- stances, the membrane surrounding blepharisma disinte- grates and comes independently loose, like a cast-offshell, leaving the creature a transient albino. At times offamine, a single blepharisma will begin eating its neighbors; it then enlarges to an immense size and turns into a cannibalistic giant, straight out ofany Norse fable. Evidently, this crea- ture still has trouble getting along with the several parts of itself, and with the collective parts of other blepharismae. There are innumerable plant-animal combinations, mostly in the sea, where the green plant cells provide car- bohydrate and oxygen for the animal and receive ashare of energy in return. It is the fairestofarrangements. When the126 The Lives ofa Cell Paramecium bursaria runs out offood, all he needs to do is stay in the sun and his green endosymbionts will keep him supplied as though he were a grain. Bacteria are the greatest of all at setting up joint enter- prises, on which the lives oftheir hosts are totally depend- ent. The nitrogen-fixing rhizobiain root nodules, the myce- tomes ofinsects, and the enzyme-producing colonies in the digestive tracts of many animals are variations of this meticulously symmetrical symbiosis. The meaning of these stories may be basically the same as the meaning ofa medieval bestiary. There is a tendency for living things to join up, establish linkages, live inside eachother, return toearlierarrangements,getalong,when- ever possible. This is the way of the world. Thenewphenomenonofcellfusion, alaboratorytrickon which much of today's science ofmolecular genetics relies for its data, is the simplest and most spectacular symbol of the tendency. In a way, it is the most unbiologic of all phenomena,violatingthemostfundamental mythofthelast century, foritdeniestheimportanceofspecif—icity, integrity, and separateness in living things. Any cell man, animal, — fish, fowl, or insect given the chance and under the right conditions, brought into contact with any other cell, how- ever foreign, will fuse with it. Cytoplasm will flow easily from one to the other, the nuclei will combine, and it will become, fora time anyway, asinglecell with twocomplete, alien genomes, ready to dance, ready to multiply. It is a Chimera, a Griffon, a Sphinx, a Ganesha, a Peruvian god, a Ch'i-lin, an omen ofgood fortune, a wish for the world.On Various Words The idea that colonies ofsocial insects are somehow equivalent to vast, multicreatured organisms, pos- sessingacollectiveintelligenceandagiftforadapta- tion far superior to the sum of the individual inhabitants, had its origin in the papers of the eminent entomologist, William MortonWheeler, whoproposed the term Superor- ganismtodescribethearrangement. From 1911 totheearly 1950sthisranked asacentralnotioninentomology,attract- ing the attention of many fascinated nonentomologists. Maeterlinck and Marais wrote best-selling books on the presumed soul that must exist somewhere in the nests of ants and termites. Then, unaccountably, the whole idea abruptly dropped out of fashion and sight. During the past quarter-century almost no mention of it is made in the proliferation of scientific literature in entomology. It is not talked about. It is not just that the idea has been forgotten; it is as though it had become unmentionable, an embarrassment. It is hard to explain. The notion was not shown to be all that mistaken, nor was it in conflict with any other, more acceptable view ofthings. It was simply that nobody could figure out what to do with such an abstraction. There it sat, occupying important intellectual ground, at just the time when entomology wasemergingasan experimental science ofconsiderable power, capable of solving matters of intri- cate detail, a paradigm ofthe new reductionism. This huge 127128 The Lives ofa Cell — idea that individual organisms might be self-transcending — in their relation to a dense society was not approachable by the new techniques, nor did it suggest new experiments or methods. It just sat there, in the way, and was covered over by leaves and papers. It needed heuristic value to survive, and this was lacking. \"Holism,\" a fabricated word, has been applied to con- cepts like the Superorganism. One wonders whether this word may not itselfhave scared offsome investigators; it is a word with an alarming visage. GeneralJan Smuts, who invented it out of whole cloth in 1926, might have done better with \"Wholism\"; it would have served the same etymological purpose and might have been just secular enough to survive this kind of century. As it is, there is doubt for its future. Holism is in some of the scientific glossaries but has not yet made it into most standard dictio- naries ofEnglish. Itgot as faras the Supplement volume of thenewOED,whichissomething, butnotenoughtoassure survival. Perhaps it will die away, along with Superorgan- ism. I cannot quarrel with any ofthis. Ifan idea cannot move on its own, pushing it doesn't help; best to let it lie there. Itmaybe, though, thatthepushingwastriedinthewrong direction. Colonies of ants or termites, or bees and social wasps, may infactbeSuperorganisms byWheeler'scriteria, butperhaps that is the end ofthat line ofinformation as far asinsectsareconcerned,forthetimebeing. Maybeitwould work better if you tried it out on another social species, easier to handle. Us, for one. It has long troubled the entomologists that the rest ofus are always interfering in their affairs by offering explana- tions ofinsect behavior in human terms. They take pains to explain that ants are not, emphatically not, tiny mechanical modelsofhuman beings. I agreewith this. Nothing thatwe knowforsureabouthuman behavioris likelytoaccountforOn Various Words 129 what ants do, and we ought to stay clear of it; this is the business ofentomologists. As for the ants themselves, they are plainly not in need of lessons from us. However, this does not mean that we cannot take it the other way, on the off chance that some of the collective actions of ants may cast light on human problems. There are lots ofpossibilities here, but ifyou think about the construction of the Hill by a colony of a million ants, each one working ceaselessly and compulsively to add per- fection to his region of the structure without having the faintest notion ofwhat is being constructed elsewhere, liv- ing out his brieflife in a social enterprise that extends back intowhatisforhimthedeepestantiquity(antsdieattherate of3-4 per cent per day; in a month or so an entire genera- tion vanishes, while the Hill can go on for sixty years or, givengood years, forever), performing his work with infal- lible, undistracted skill in themidstofaconfusion ofothers, all tumbling over each other to get the twigs and bits of earth aligned in precisely the right configurations for the warmth and ventilation of the eggs and larvae, but totally incapacitated by isolation, there is only one human activity that is like this, and it is language. We have been working at it for what seems eternity, generation after articulate generation, and still we have no notion how itisdone, norwhatitwill belikewhen finished, ifit is ever to be finished. It is the mostcompulsively collec- tive, genetically programmed, species-specific, and auto- nomic ofall the things we do, and we are infallible at it. It comes naturally. We have DNA for grammar, neurons for syntax. We can never let up; we scramble our way through one civilization after another, metamorphosing, sprouting tools and cities everywhere, and all the time new words keep tumbling out. The words themselves are marvels, each one perfectly designed for its use. The older, more powerful ones are130 The Lives ofa Cell membranous, packed with layers ofdifferent meaning, like one-wordpoems. \"Articulated,\" forinstance, firstindicated a division into small joints, then, effortlessly, signified the speaking of sentences. Some words are gradually altered while we have them in everyday use, without our being awareuntil thechangehas beencompleted: the lyin today's adverbs, suchasablyand benignly, began toappearinplace of\"like\" justafewcenturiesago,and \"like\" hassinceworn away to a mere suffix. By a similar process, \"love-did\" changed itself into \"loved.\" Noneofthewordsareevermadeupbyanyoneweknow; they simply turn up in the language when they are needed. Sometimesafamiliarword willsuddenlybegrabbed upand transformed to mean something quite strange: \"strange\" is itself such a word today, needed by nuclear physicists to symbolize the behavior ofparticles which decay with pecu- liar slowness; the technical term for such particles now is \"strange particles,\" and they possess a \"strangeness num- bers).\" The shock of sudden unfamiliarity with an old, familiar word is something we take in stride; it has been going on for thousands of years. A few words are made up by solitary men in frontofour eyes, like Holism out ofSmuts, or Quark out ofJoyce, but most of these are exotic and transient; it takes a great deal of use before a word can become a word. Most new words are made up from other, earlier words; language-making is a conservative process, wasting little. When newwordsunfoldoutofoldones, theoriginal mean- ingusuallyhangsaround likeanunrecognizablescent,asort of secret. \"Holism\" suggestssomethingbiologicallytranscendental becauseof\"holy,\" although itwas intended moresimply to mean a complete assemblage of living units. Originally, it camefromtheIndo-Europeanrootword kailo, whichmeant whole, also intact and uninjured. During passage throughOn Various Words 131 several thousand years ittransformed into hail, hale, health, hallow, holy, whole, and heal, and all of these still move together through our minds. \"Heuristic\" is a more specialized, single-purpose word, derived from Indo-European wer, meaning to find, then takenupinGreekas heuriskein, fromwhichArchimedeswas provided with Heureka! There are two immense words from Indo-European, gene and bheu, each avirtualanthill in itself, from which we have constructed the notion ofEverything. At the beginning, or as far back as they are traceable, they meant something like being. Gene signified beginning, giving birth, while bheu indicated existence and growth. Gene turned itself succes- sively into kundjaz (Germanic) and gecynd (Old English), meaning kin or kind. Kind was at first a family connection, later an elevated social rank, and finally came to rest mean- ing kindly or gentle. Meanwhile, a branch of gene became the Latin gens, then gentle itself; it also emerged as genus, genius, genital, and generous; then, still holding on to its inner significance, it became \"nature\" (out of gnasci). Whilegene was evolving into \"nature\" and \"kind,\" bheu was moving through similar transformations. One branch became bowan inGermanicand bua'mOld Norse, meaning toliveanddwell,and thentheEnglishwordbuild. Itmoved into Greek, as phuein, meaning to bring forth and make grow; then as phusis, which was another word for nature. Phusis became the source of physic, which at first meant natural science and later was the word for medicine. Still later, physic became physics. Both words, at today's stage of their evolution, can be taken together to mean, literally, everything in the uni- verse. You do not come by words like this easily; they cannot just be made up from scratch. They need long lives before they can signify. \"Everything,\" C.S. Lewis observed in a discussion ofthe words, \"is a subject on which there is132 The Lives ofa Cell notmuch to be said.\" The words themselves mustshow the internal marks of long use; they must contain their own inner conversation. These days it is reassuring to know that nature and phys- ics, in their present meanings, have been interconnected in our minds, by asortofhunch, forall these years. The other words clinging to them are a puzzlement, but nice to see. Ifyou let your mind relax, all the words will flow into each other in an amiable sort ofnonsense. \"Kind\" means a rela- tion, but it also means \"nature.\" The word for kind is the same as the word for gentle. Even \"physics,\" save us, is a kind of\"nature,\" by its nature, and is, simultaneously, an- other kind of kind. There are ancient ideas reverberating through this structure, very old hunches. It is part ofthe magic of language that some people can get to the same place by the use of totally different words. JulianofNorwich, afourteenth-centuryhermitess, said itso well thataparagraphofherswasused recentlybyaphysicist for his introduction to a hard-science review ofcontempo- rarycosmologicalphysics: \"Heshowed mealittlething, the quantity ofan hazelnut, in the palm ofmy hand, and it was as round as a ball. I looked thereupon with eye of my understanding and thought: What may this be? And it was answered generally thus: it is all that is made.\"Living Language Stigmergy\" isanewword, invented recentlybyGrasse toexplain the nest-building behavioroftermites, per- hapsgeneralizabletoothercomplexactivitiesofsocial animals. The word is made of Greek roots meaning \"to incite to work,\" and Grasse's intention was to indicate that it is the productofwork itselfthatprovides both the stimu- lusand instructionsforfurtherwork. Hearrivedatthisafter longobservationoftheconstructionoftermite nests, which exceptingperhapsaman-madecity are the mostformidable edifices in nature. Whenyouconsiderthesizeofan individ- ual termite, photographed standing alongside his nest, he ranks with the New Yorker and shows a better sense of organization than a resident of Los Angeles. Some of the mound nests of Macrotermes bellicosus in Africa measure twelve feet high and a hundred feet across, they contain several millions oftermites, and around them are clustered other small and younger mounds, like suburbs. The interior of the nests are like a three-dimensional maze, intricate arrangements of spiraling galleries, corri- dors, and arched vaults, ventilated and air-conditioned. There are great caverns for the gardens offungi on which the termites depend for their nourishment, perhaps also as asourceofheat.Thereisaroundedvaultedchamberforthe queen, called the royal cell. The fundamental structural unit, on which the whole design is based, is the arch. 133134 The Lives ofa Cell Grasseneeded hisword inordertoaccountfortheability ofsuch tiny, blind, and relatively brainless animals to erect structures of such vast size and internal complexity. Does eachtermitepossessafragmentofblueprint,oristhewhole design, arch by arch, encoded in his DNA? Or does the whole colony have, by virtue ofthe interconnections ofso many small brains, the collective intellectual power of a huge contractor? Grasse placed a handful of termites in a dish filled with soil and fecal pellets (these are made of lignin, a sort of micro-lumber) and watched whattheydid. Theydid not, in the first place, behave at all like contractors. Nobody stood around in place and gave orders or collected fees; they all simply ran around, picking up pellets at random and drop- ping them again. Then, by chance, two or three pellets happened tolightontopofeachother,and thistransformed the behavior ofeveryone. Now they displayed thegreatest interestanddirected theirattentionobsessivelytotheprimi- tive column, adding new pellets and fragments of earth. After reaching a certain height, the construction stopped unless another column was being formed nearby; in this case the structure changed from acolumn to an arch, bend- ing off in a smooth curve, the arch was joined, and the termites then set off to build another. Buildinga language may be something like this. Onecan imagine primitive proto-Indo-European men finding them- selves clustered together, making random sounds, sur- rounded, say, by bees, and one of them suddenly saying \"bbei,\"and thentherestofthempickingitupand repeating \"bhei\" and thus beginning that part oflanguage, but this is arestricted, too mechanisticviewofthings. Itmakes pellets out ofphonemes, implies that the deep structures ofgram- mar are made of something like cement. I do not care for this. More likely, language is simply alive, like an organism.Living Language 135 We tell each other this, in fact, when we speak of living languages, and I think we mean something more than an abstract metaphor. We mean alive. Words are the cells of language, moving the great body, on legs. Languagegrows and evolves, leaving fossils behind. The individual wordsare likedifferentspecies ofanimals. Muta- tions occur. Words fuse, and then mate. Hybrid words and wild varieties of compound words are the progeny. Some mixed words are dominated by one parent while the other is recessive. The way a word is used this year is its pheno- type, but it has a deeply seated, immutable meaning, often hidden, which is the genotype. Thelanguageofgeneticsmightbeused insomesuchway todescribethegeneticsoflanguage, ifweknewmoreabout both. The separate languages of the Indo-European family were at one time, perhaps five thousand years ago, maybe much longer, a single language. The separation of the speakers by migrations had effects on language comparable to the speciation observed by Darwin on various islands of Galapagos. Languages became different species, retaining enough resemblance to an original ancestor so that the family resemblance can still be seen. Variation has been maintained by occasional contact between different islands of speakers, and perhaps also by random mutations. But there is something else about words that gives them the look and feel ofliving motile beings with mindsoftheir own. This is best experienced by looking them up, prefera- bly in one ofthe dictionaries that provide all the roots back to the original, hypothetical fossil language ofproto-Indo- European, and observing their behavior. Some words started from Indo-European and swarmed into religion over a very large part ofthe earth. The word blaghmen, for example, meant priest. It moved into Latin and Middle English asftamen, a pagan word for priest, and136 The Lives ofa Cell into Sanskrit as brahma, then \"brahman.\" Weid, a word meaning to see, with laterconnotations ofwisdom and wit, entered Germanic as whan, and Old English wis to \"wis- dom.\" It became videre in Latin, hence \"vision.\" Finally, in its suffixed form woid-o, it became the Sanskrit word veda. Beudh traveled a similar distance. With the meaning of awareness, it became beodan in Old English, meaning \"bode,\" and bodhati in Sanskrit, meaning he awakes, is enlightened, and thus Bodhisattva, and Buddha. The sattva part of Bodhisattva came from the Indo- European word es, meaning to be, or is, which, on its way into Sanskrit as sat and sant, also became esse in Latin and einai in Greek; einai became the-ontincertain words signi- fying being, such as \"symbiont.\" The Indo-European word bbag, meaningtoshare, turned into the Greek phagein, to eat, and the Old Persian bakhsh (yielding \"baksheesh,\" and, in Sanskrit, with the meaning of bhage, good fortune, it emerged as Bhagavad-gita (the gita from get, a song). The Hari-Krishna people are chanting something closer to English than it sounds. Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, has his name from the Sanskrit Krsnah, the black one, which came from the Indo-European word for black, kers (which also produced \"chernozem,\" black topsoil, by the way of the Russian chernyi). There is obviously no end to this; it can tie up a whole life, and has luckily done just that during the past century for generations ofcomparative linguists. Their science be- gan properly in 1786 with the discoveryofthe similarity of Sanskrit to Greek and Latin, by William Jones. In 1817, withapublication byFranzBopp, itbecamerecognized that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Persian, and all the Germanic lan- guages were so closely related toeach other thatacommon ancestor must have existed earlier. Since then, this scienceLiving Language 137 has developed in more or less parallel with biology, but more quietly. It is a field in which the irresponsible amateur can have a continually mystifying sort offun. Whenever you get the availableanswertoastraightquestion, like, say, wheredoes the most famous and worst of the four-letter Anglo-Saxon unprintable words come from, the answer raises new and discomfiting questions. Take that particular word. It comes frompeig, acrawling,wicked Indo-Europeanword meaning evil and hostile, the sure makings of a curse. It becomes poikos, then gafaihaz in Germanic and gefah in Old English, signifying \"foe.\" It turned from poik-yos intofaigjaz in Ger- manic, andfaege in Old English, meaning fated to die, lead- ing to \"fey.\" It went on from fehida in Old English to become \"feud,\" andfokken in Old Dutch. Somehow, from these beginnings, it transformed itselfinto one ofthe most powerful English expletives, meaning something like \"Die before your time!\" The unspeakable malevolence of the message is now buried deepinsidetheword, and outon the surface it presents itself as merely an obscenity. \"Leech\" is a fascinating word. It is an antique term for physician, and also for the aquatic worm sanguisugus, used forleeching.Thetwowordsappeartobequiteseparate, but there is something like biological mimicry going on: leech thedoctormeansthedoctorwhousesleechtheworm;leech theworm isasymbolforthedoctor. Leech thedoctorcomes from the Indo-European leg, which meant to collect, with numerous derivatives meaning to speak. Leg became Ger- manic lekjaz, meaning one who speaks magic words, an enchanter, and also laece in Old English, meaningphysician. (In Denmark the word for doctor is still laege, in Swedish lakare.) Leg in its senses ofgathering, choosing, and speak- ing gave rise to the Latin legere, and thus words like \"lec- ture\" and \"legible.\" In Greek, it became legein, meaning to gatherand tospeak; \"legal\" and \"legislator\" and othersuch138 The Lives ofa Cell words derived. Leg was further transformed in Greek to logos, signifying reason. All this historyseems bothplausibleand creditable,good readingfordoctors, butthereisalways thatotherleech, the worm. It is not certain how it came. Somehow it began its descent through the language at the same time as leech the doctor, turning up as both laece and lyce in Old English, always recognizable as something distinctly the worm and at the same time important in medicine. It also took on the meaning ofsomeone parasitic, living on the flesh ofothers. Gradually, perhaps underthe influenceofaMiddle English AMA, the worm wasgiven sole rights to the word, and the doctor became the doctor, out of dek, meaning to accept, later to teach. Man is an unchanged word from Indo-European man, meaning just that. But two other important words for man have stranger sources. One is dhghem, meaning earth; this became guman in Germanic, gumen in Old English, then homo and humanus in Latin, from which we have both \"hu- man\" and \"humus.\" The other word for man contains the same admonition, but turns the message around. It is wiros, meaning man in Indo-European, taken as weraldh in Ger- manic and weorold in Old English, emerging, flabbergast- ingly, as \"world.\" This must be a hard science to work in. You might think thatwithaword forearthgivingrisetooneimportantword for man, and an early word for man turning into the word for the world, you would find a parallel development in otherwords fortheearth. Notso: the Indo-European word ers, which later became \"earth,\" has evolved only one ani- mal that I can find mentioned, and it is the aardvark. I amglad to have a semipermeable memory aftergetting into this. Ifyou had to speak English with running captions in your mind showing all the roots, all the way back to Indo-European, you'd fall off the bicycle. Speaking is anLiving Language 139 autonomic business; you may search for words as you go along, but they are found for you by agents in your brain over which you exercise no direct control. You really couldn't be thinking Indo-European at the same time, with- out going speechless or babbling (from baba, meaning in- distinct speech, Russian balalayka, Latin balbus, meaning \"booby,\" Old French baboue, leading to \"baboon,\" Greek barbaros, meaningforeignorrude,andSanskrit babu, mean- ing father). That sort of thing. I got into even more trouble while looking into \"Stig- mergy.\" I was looking for other words for inciting and instigatingwork,and cameupon \"toeggon.\"Theegghere comes from ak, a word for sharp, suffixed to akjo in Ger- manic, meaning \"edge,\" and to akjan in Old Norse, mean- ing\"egg,\" toincite,goad; thesamerootmoveson intoOld Englishas aehherand ear, forearofcorn. (Corn, ifyou have a moment, is from grew, for grain, which became korn in Old High German, granum in Latin, and cyrnel in Old En- glish, thence \"kernel.\") But neither the egg nor the ear from ak are the real egg or ear. The real egg comes from awi, meaningbird, which turned into avisand ovum inLatin (notknown,ofcourse,whichcamefirst), into oion inGreek, and was compounded with spek (to see) to form awispek, \"watcher ofbirds\" which became auspex in Latin, meaning augur. The real ear began as ous, then auzan in Germanic, and eare in Old English and auri in Latin; along the way, it was compounded with sleg, meaning slack, and transformed to lagous, meaning \"with drooping ears,\" which then became lagos, Greek for rabbit. There is noway to stop, once you've started, noteven by trying to round a circle. Ous became aus became \"ausculta- tion,\" which is what leeches (leg) doforaliving (leip) unless they are legal (leg) leeches, which, incidentally, is not the same thing as lawyers (Ugh).140 The Lives ofa Cell That should be enough (nek, to attain, becoming ganoga in Germanic and genog in Old English, also onkos in Greek, meaning burden, hence \"oncology\") to give you the gen- eral (gene) idea(weidbecoming widesya then idea inGreek). — Itiseasy to losethethread (from ter, torub, twist possibly also the root of termite).

Even more astounding is our statistical improbability in physical terms. The normal, predictable state of matter throughout the universe is randomness, a relaxed sort of equilibrium, withatomsand theirparticlesscattered around inanamorphous muddle. We, in brilliantcontrast, arecom- pletely organized structures, squirming with information at every covalent bond. We make our living by catching elec- trons at the moment of their excitement by solar photons, swiping the energy released at the instant ofeach jump and storing it up in intricate loops for ourselves. We violate probability, by our nature. To be able to do this systemi- cally, and in such wild varieties of form, from viruses to whales, is extremely unlikely; to have sustained the effort successfully for the several billion years of our existence, without drifting back into randomness, was nearly a math- ematical impossibility. Add to this the biological improbability that makes each member of our own species unique. Everyone is one in 3 billion at the moment, which describes the odds. Each ofus is a self-contained, free-standing individual, labeled by spe- 141142 The Lives ofa Cell cific protein configurations at the surfaces ofcells, identifi- able by whorls of fingertip skin, maybe even by special medleysoffragrance. You'd thinkwe'd neverstopdancing. Perhaps it is not surprising that we do not live more surprised. After all, we are used to unlikelihood. Being born into it, raised in it, we become acclimated to the alti- tude, like natives in the Andes. Moreover, we all know that the astonishment is transient, and sooner or later our parti- cles will all go back to being random. Also, there are reasons to suspect that we are really not the absolute, pure entities that we seem. We have some sense ofordinariness, and it tends to diminish our surprise. Despite all the evidences of biological privacy in our cells and tissues (to the extent that a fragmentofcell membrane will be recognized and rejected between any conceivable pairs among the 3 billion, excepting identical twins), there is a certain slippage in our brains. No one, in fact, can lay claim with certainty to his own mind with anything like the specificity stipulated by fingerprints or tissue antigens. The human brain is the most public organ on the face of the earth, open to everything, sending out messages to ev- erything. Tobesure, itishiddenawayin boneandconducts internal affairs in secrecy, butvirtuallyall the business is the direct result ofthinking that has already occurred in other minds. We pass thoughts around, from mind to mind, so compulsively and with such speed that the brains of man- kind often appear, functionally, to be undergoing fusion. This is, when you think about it, really amazing. The — whole dear notion ofone's own Self marvelous old free- willed, free-enterprising, autonomous, independent, iso- — lated island of a Self is a myth. We do not yet have a science strong enough to displace the myth. Ifyou could label, bysomeequivalentofradioac- tive isotopes, all the bits of human thought that are con- stantly adrift, likeplankton, all around us, itmight bepossi- iOn Probability and Possibility 143 ble to discern some sort ofsystematic order in the process, but, as it is, it seems almost entirely random. There has to be something wrong with this view. It is hard to see how we could be in possession of an organ so complex and intricate and, as it occasionally reveals itself, so powerful, and be using it on such a scale just for the production ofa kind of background noise. Somewhere, obscured by the snatches ofconversation, pages ofold letters, bits ofbooks and magazines, memories ofold movies, and the disorder ofradio and television, there ought to be more intelligible signals. Or perhaps we are only at the beginning of learning to usethesystem, withalmostallourevolutionasaspeciesstill aheadofus.

Later, when the time is right, there may be fusion and symbiosis among the bits, and then we will see eukaryotic thought, metazoans of thought, huge interliving coral shoals of thought. The mechanism is there, and there is no doubt that it is already capable offunctioning, even though the total yield thus far seems to consist largely of bits. After all, it has to be said that we've been at it for only the briefest time in evolutionaryterms,afewthousand yearsoutofbillions,and during most ofthis time the scattered aggregates ofhuman thought have been located patchilyaround theearth. There may be some laws about this kind ofcommunication, man- dating acritical density and mass before itcan function with efficiency. Only in this century have we been brought close144 The Lives ofa Cell enough toeachother, ingreatnumbers, to begin thefusion around the earth, and from now on the process may move very rapidly. There is, if it goes well, quite a lot to look forward to. Already, by luck, we have seen the assembly ofparticles of exchanged thought into today's structures of art and science. It is done by simply passing the bits around from mind to mind, until something like natural selection makes the final selection, all on grounds of fitness. The real surprises, which set us back on our heels when We theyoccur, willalways bethemutants. havealreadyhad a few ofthese, sweeping across the field ofhuman thought periodically, likecomets. Theyhaveslightlydifferentrecep- tors forthe information cascading in from otherminds, and slightly different machinery for processing it, so that what comes out to rejoin the flow is novel, and filled with new sorts of meaning. Bach was able to do this, and what emerged in the current were primordia in music. In this sense, the Art ofFugue and the St. Matthew Passion were, for the evolving organism of human thought, feathered wings, apposing thumbs, new layers of frontal cortex. But we may not be so dependent on mutants from here on, or perhaps there are more of them around than we recognize. What we need is more crowding, more unre- strained and obsessive communication, more open chan- nels, even more noise, and a bit more luck. We are simul- taneously participants and bystanders, which is a puzzling role to play. As participants, we have no choice in the mat- ter; thisiswhatwedoasaspecies. Asbystanders, stand back and give it room is my advice.TheWorlds Membrane Biggest Viewedfromthedistanceofthemoon, theastonishing thing about the earth, catching the breath, is that it is alive. The photographs show the dry, pounded surfaceofthe moon in theforeground, dead asanold bone. Aloft, floating free beneath the moist, gleaming membrane of bright blue sky, is the rising earth, the only exuberant thing in this part of the cosmos. If you could look long enough, you would see the swirling of the great drifts of white cloud, covering and uncovering the half-hidden masses of land. If you had been looking for a very long, geologic time, you could have seen the continents them- selves in motion, drifting apart on their crustal plates, held afloat by the fire beneath. It has the organized, self-con- tained look of a live creature, full of information, marvel- ously skilled in handling the sun. It takes a membrane to make sense out of disorder in biology. You have to be able to catch energy and hold it, storing precisely the needed amount and releasing it in measured shares. A cell does this, and so do the organelles inside. Eachassemblageispoised intheflowofsolarenergy, tappingoffenergy from metabolic surrogatesofthesun. To stay alive, you have to be able to hold out against equilib- rium, maintain imbalance, bank against entropy, and you can only transact this business with membranes in our kind of world. When the earth came alive it began constructing its own membrane, for the general purpose of editing the sun. 145146 The Lives ofa Cell Originally, in the time ofprebiotic elaboration ofpeptides and nucleotides from inorganic ingredients in the wateron the earth, there was nothing to shield out ultraviolet radia- tion except the water itself. The first thin atmosphere came entirely from the degassing of the earth as it cooled, and there was only a vanishingly small trace of oxygen in it. Theoretically, there could have been some production of oxygen by photodissociation of water vapor in ultraviolet light, but not much. This process would have been self- limiting,asUreyshowed, sincethewavelengthsneededfor photolysis are the very ones screened out selectively by oxygen; the production ofoxygen would have been cut off almost as soon as it occurred. The formation ofoxygen had to await the emergence of photosynthetic cells, and these were required to live in an environment with sufficient visible light for photosynthesis but shielded at the same time against lethal ultraviolet. Berkner and Marshall calculate that the green cells must therefore have been about ten meters below the surface of water, probably in pools and ponds shallow enough to lack strong convection currents (the ocean could not have been the starting place). You could say that the breathing of oxygen into the at- mosphere was the resultofevolution, or you could turn it aroundand saythatevolutionwastheresultofoxygen. You can have it either way. Once the photosynthetic cells had appeared, veryprobably counterparts oftoday's blue-green algae, thefuture respiratory mechanismofthe earth was set in place. Early on, when the level ofoxygen had builtup to around 1 percentoftoday'satmosphericconcentration, the anaerobic life ofthe earth was placed in jeopardy, and the inevitable next stage was the emergence of mutants with oxidative systems and ATP. With this, we were off to an explosive developmental stage in which great varieties of respiringlife, includingthemulticellularforms, becamefea- sible.The World's Biggest Membrane 147 Berkner has suggested that there were two such explo- sions of new life, like vast embryological transformations, both dependent on threshold levels ofoxygen. The first, at 1 percentofthepresentlevel, shielded outenough ultravi- olet radiation topermitcells to move into the surface layers of lakes, rivers, and oceans. This happened around 600 millionyearsago, atthe beginningofthePaleozoicera, and accounts for the sudden abundance of marine fossils of all kinds in the record of this period. The second burst oc- curredwhenoxygenroseto 10percentofthepresentlevel. At this time, around 400 million years ago, there was a sufficient canopy to allow life outofthe water and onto the land. From here on it was clear going, with nothing to restrainthevarietyoflifeexceptthelimitsofbiologicinven- tiveness. It is another illustration ofour fantastic luck that oxygen filters out the very bands of ultraviolet light that are most devastating for nucleic acids and proteins, while allowing full penetration ofthe visible light needed forphotosynthe- sis. If it had not been for this semipermeability, we could never have come along. The earth breathes, in a certain sense. Berkner suggests that there may have been cycles ofoxygen production and carbon dioxide consumption, depending on relative abun- dances ofplant and animal life, with the ice ages represent- ing periods ofapnea. An overwhelming richness ofvegeta- tion may have caused the level of oxygen to rise above today's concentration, with a corresponding depletion of carbon dioxide. Such a drop in carbon dioxide may have impaired the \"greenhouse\" property of the atmosphere, which holds in the solar heat otherwise lost by radiation from the earth's surface. The fall in temperature would in turn have shut off much of living, and, in a long sigh, the level ofoxygen may have dropped by 90 percent. Berkner speculates that this is what happened to the great reptiles; their size may have been all right for a richly oxygenated148 The Lives ofa Cell atmosphere, but they had the bad luck to run out ofair. Now we are protected against lethal ultraviolet rays by a narrow rim of ozone, thirty miles out. We are safe, well ventilated, and incubated, provided we can avoid technolo- gies that might fiddle with that ozone, or shift the levels of carbon dioxide. Oxygen is not a major worry for us, unless we let fly with enough nuclear explosives to kill off the green cells in the sea; ifwe do that, ofcourse, we are in for strangling. It is hard to feel affection for something as totally imper- sonal as the atmosphere, and yet there it is, as much a part and productoflifeas wineorbread. Takenall inall, thesky is a miraculous achievement. It works, and for what it is designed to accomplish it is as infallible as anything in na- ture. I doubt whether any of us could think of a way to improve on it, beyond maybe shifting a local cloud from here to there on occasion. The word \"chance\" does not serve to account well for structures of such magnificence. There may have been elements ofluck in theemergence of chloroplasts, but once these things were on the scene, the evolution of the sky became absolutely ordained. Chance suggests alternatives, otherpossibilities, different solutions. Thismaybetrueforgillsand swim-bladdersand forebrains, matters ofdetail, but not for the sky. There was simply no other way to go. We should credit it for what it is: for sheer size and perfection offunction, it is far and away thegrandest prod- uct of collaboration in all of nature. It breathes for us, and it does another thing for ourplea- sure. Each day, millions ofmeteorites fall against the outer limits of the membrane and are burned to nothing by the friction. Without this shelter, our surface would long since have become the pounded powder of the moon. Even though our receptors are not sensitive enough to hear it, there is comfort in knowing that the sound is there over- head, like the random noise of rain on the roof at night.Reference Notes Thoughtsfor a Countdown Hanks, J.

Extending beyond the usual limitations of biological science and into a vast and wondrous world of hidden relationships, this provocative book explores in personal, poetic essays topics such as computers, germs, language, music, death, insects, and medicine.
